                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. When antiepileptics phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital were coadministered with albendazole, significantly reduced levels of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were observed, appaprently due to induction of CYP3A4. As etravirine may also induce CYP3A4, an interaction with albendazole cannot be ruled out. </span>

                    <span><p>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

<p>Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital appear to induce the oxidative metabolism of albendazole via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A by roughly the same extent, resulting in significantly reduced concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide. This interaction is likely to be clinically significant when albendazole is used to treat systemic worm infections, and increased doses of albendazole would be needed. The interaction is probably not clinically significant when albendazole is used for intestinal worm infections. <br /><em>Lanchote VL, et al.

Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg.

Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as efavirenz and nevirapine) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.<br /></em></span>

Artemisinins undergo rapid metabolism via several CYP450 (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2B6) and the active metabolite (dihydroartemisinin, which has greater potency than the parent drug) is further metabolism via UGT1A9 and 2B7. Etravirine could potentially increase the conversion of artemether and arteether to the active metabolite. The clinical relevance is unclear. Artemisinins induce CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19 and could potentially decrease etravirine concentrations through CYP induction.

<p>Etravirine and atazanavir/ritonavir can be used without dose adjustment.

<p>Etravirine should not be co-administered with atazanavir without low-dose ritonavir. Concomitant use of etravirine with atazanavir without low-dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of atazanavir. Etravirine and atazanavir/ritonavir should not be co-administered. Concomitant use of etravirine with atazanavir/ritonavir may cause a significant decrease in atazanavir Cmin and loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir. In addition, the mean systemic exposure (AUC) of etravirine after co-administration of etravirine with atazanavir/ritonavir is anticipated to be higher than the mean systemic exposure of etravirine observed in the Phase 3 trials after co-administration of etravirine and darunavir/ritonavir (as part of the background regimen). Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and etravirine was studied in 14 subjects. Etravirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 47%, 50% and 58%, respectively; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 3%, 17% and 47%, respectively. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and etravirine was studied in 14 subjects. Etravirine Cmax and AUC increased by 30%, Cmin increased by 26%.

Exposure to TMC125 increased when given with atazanavir (Cmin increased by 58%, Cmax by 47%, AUC by 50%) and to a lesser extent with atazanavir/ritonavir (Cmin increased by 26%, Cmax by 30%, AUC by 30%). When atazanavir was coadministered with TMC125, atazanavir Cmin decreased by 47%, Cmax by 3% and AUC by 17%. Coadministration of TMC125 to atazanavir/ritonavir decreased atazanavir Cmin by 38%, Cmax by 3% and AUC by 14%. The increase in TMC exposure is not considered to be clinically relevant; however, due to the decrease in atazanavir Cmin, atazanavir should only be used with TMC125 in the presence of low dose ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of TMC125 with atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been formally studied but may increase etravirine concentrations and decrease atovaquone concentrations. A case report showed coadministration of atovaquone/proguanil in a patient treated with etravirine increased etravirine AUC by 55%. Data from a study with efavirenz showed the AUCs of atovaquone and proguanil decreased by 70% and 50%, respectively, with the putative mechanism being attributed to induction of glucuronidation by efavirenz. Due to its potential to induce glucuronidation, etravirine could also potentially decrease atovaquone exposure. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

<div>Etravirine is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 followed by glucuronidation of the metabolites by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT). Co-administration of etravirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may decrease the clearance of etravirine and may result in increased plasma concentrations of etravirine. Etravirine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4. Co-administration of etravirine with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 may result in decreased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effects.<br /><em>Intelence&#174; (etravirine) 200mg UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, updated August 2012</em></div></span>

                    <span><p>When administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone, used cautiously, is recommended. When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4, e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort, an adjustment of the dosage of buspirone may be necessary to maintain buspirone&#8217;s anxiolytic effect.<br /><em>Buspirone Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, August 2012.</em></p>
<p>Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone or certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Consequently, when administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended. When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4 the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect.<br /><em>Buspar Prescribing Information, Bristol Myers Squibb, November 2010.</em></p></span>

About 22% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.<br /><em>Piriton&#174; (Chlorphenamine) Tablets&nbsp; UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, updated May 2010</em></p>
<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

<p>Coadministration of etravirine (200 mg twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was studied in 16 subjects. Clarithromycin increased etravirine exposure by 42%, whereas etravirine decreased clarithromycin exposure by 39% and increased 14-OH clarithromycin exposure by 21%. No serious adverse events were reported. Short-term etravirine coadministration with clarithromycin was well tolerated. No dose adjustments are required upon etravirine/clarithromycin coadministration, but alternatives to clarithromycin are recommended when used for Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis or treatment.&nbsp;<br><em>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the interaction between etravirine and rifabutin or clarithromycin in HIV-negative, healthy volunteers: results from two Phase 1 studies.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. In vitro studies have suggested that CYP3A4 does not affect conversion of clomifene to its active metabolite, and that this transformation is likely to be mediated via CYP2D6. There is therefore little potential for etravirine to affect this metabolic pathway.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the 14C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.<br /><em>Clomid&#174; (clomiphene citrate tablets USP) US Prescribing Information, Sanofi-aventis U.S. revised June 2006</em></p>
<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. These studies suggest that inducers of CYP3A4 (such as etravirine) may increase metabolism of vitamin D and therefore reduce its effect. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.</span>

<p>Etravirine and darunavir/ritonavir can be used without dose adjustments.

<p>The mean systemic exposure (AUC) of etravirine was reduced when etravirine was co-administered with darunavir/ritonavir. Because all subjects in the Phase 3 trials received darunavir/ritonavir as part of the background regimen and etravirine exposures from these trials were determined to be safe and effective, etravirine and darunavir/ritonavir can be co-administered without dose adjustments. Coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) and etravirine was studied in 15 subjects. Data from 14 subjects showed that etravirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 32%, 37% and 49%, respectively. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 11%, 15% and 2%, respectively. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<div>The addition of etravirine (200 mg twice daily) to raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) lead to significant increases in the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of both raltegravir (29%, 21% and 54%, respectively) and darunavir (14%, 6%, and 29%, respectively). Ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 3%, 5% and 11%, respectively.&nbsp; The authors point to the marked variability of raltegravir pharmacokinetics (particularly higher trough concentrations after the evening dose), but do not offer an explanation for the increase.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of etravirine, raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir in treatment experienced patients.

<div>The pharmacokinetic interaction between etravirine (100 or 200 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was investigated in two groups of HIV- subjects. Coadministration of 100 mg etravirine with darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of etravirine by 37%, 32% and 49% respectively. Coadministration had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine or ritonavir. Increasing the dose of etravirine to 200 mg (the dose chosen for Phase III trials) resulted in increases in etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 80%, 81% and 67% respectively when coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir and compared to etravirine 100 mg given alone. Darunavir AUC and Cmax were increased by 15% and 11% respectively, with no change in Cmin. Etravirine (200 mg twice daily) can be coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir without dose adjustments. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir and TMC125 alone and coadministered in HIV-negative volunteers.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction.

                    <span><p>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p>
<p>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em></p>
<p>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

                    <span>In the gut, diloxanide furoate is largely, if not wholly, hydrolysed into diloxanide and furoic acid under the combined action of bacterial and gut esterases. After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

However, the European SPC suggests a dose of dolutegravir of 50 mg twice daily when coadministered with etravirine without boosted protease inhibitors to patients without INSTI resistance, but recommends dolutegravir and etravirine should be administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir in INSTI-resistant patients.

Steady state etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly lower after efavirenz intake in the once daily and twice daily arms. Etravirine AUC, Cmax and Ctrough when given once daily decreased by 29%, 22% and 33%, respectively. When given twice daily, etravirine AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 28%, 21% and 37%, respectively. All subjects had detectable efavirenz concentrations 7 days after stopping efavirenz intake; 5/25 had concentrations above the suggested minimum effective concentration of 1000 ng/ml. The authors conclude that the induction effect of efavirenz persists for at least 2 weeks after stopping drug intake, but that the decrease in etravirine is not likely to be clinically significant. However, further clinical data are warranted. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of etravirine administered once or twice daily after 2 weeks treatment with efavirenz in healthy volunteers.

<p>Eflornithine was administered to six healthy men in single intravenous doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and oral doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 hr after oral doses. The decay of the plasma concentrations followed first-order kinetics with a mean half-life (t 1/2) for all four doses studied of 199 +/- 6 min (+/- SD). Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight. The amount of unchanged drug in 24-hr urine samples was 47 +/- 7% and 40 +/- 11% after 10 and 20 mg/kg orally, and 78% and 81 +/- 8% after 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Twenty-four-hour urinary recovery of unchanged drug was 46.9% of the 10mg/kg and 40.3% of the 20 mg/kg oral doses. &gt;86% of the oral doses were cleared from the body by renal filtration.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Formoterol is eliminated primarily by direct glucuronidation, with O-demethylation (by CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 2A6) followed by further glucuronidation being another pathway. As multiple CYP450 and UGT enzymes catalyze the transformation the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction is low.</span>

<div>Coadministration of etravirine and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) to 8 subjects increased amprenavir AUC, Cmin and Cmax by 69%, 77% and 62%, respectively. Compared to historic controls, there was no change in etravirine AUC, Cmin or Cmax.

Compared to historical controls, there was no effect etravirine AUC, Cmax or Cmin. Amprenavir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir may require dose reduction when co administered with etravirine.

<p>Coadministration with fosamprenavir alone or fosamprenavir/ritonavir is contraindicated. Concomitant use of etravirine with fosamprenavir without low-dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration (increase) in the plasma concentrations of the PI. Due to a significant increase in the systemic exposure of amprenavir, the appropriate doses of the combination of etravirine and fosamprenavir/ritonavir have not been established. Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) and etravirine to 8 subjects increased amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 62%, 69% and 77% respectively. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) and etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Amprenavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 69%, 62% and 77%, respectively. There was no significant effect on ritonavir AUC (no change), Cmax (2% increase) or Cmin (10% decrease). Plasma concentrations of etravirine were similar to historical data in HIV+ subjects. Dose adjustments of fosamprenavir may have to be considered when combined with etravirine. <br /><em>Scholler-Gyure M, Woodfall B, Bollen S et al.

<p>Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration.&nbsp; After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches, but does not equal, the daily dose administered.&nbsp; As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys.&nbsp; Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine of some patients weeks after drug administration was discontinued.&nbsp; Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin but etravirine is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). Etravirine does not induce UGT2B7 but is a weak inhibitor of P-gp and could potentially increase the amount of morphine entering the CNS and thus potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS. Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of etravirine via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both ifosfamide metabolites. induction of CYP2B enzymes by high-dose phenobarbital pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of ifosfamide undergoing 4-hydroxylation  from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. As etravirine is an enzyme inducer, there is potential for ifosfamide levels to be reduced if coadministered.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>In an animal study in which rats were treated with ifosfamide alone or in conjunction with various P450 inducers and inhibitors, induction of liver P450 2B enzymes by 4-day high-dose phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of IF undergoing 4-hydroxylation&nbsp; from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. Pretreatment with the P450 3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both IF metabolites, without any net impact on the fraction of IF undergoing metabolic activation. These findings demonstrate specific roles for P450 2B and 3A enzymes in catalysing these pathways of IF metabolism in vivo. These studies also highlight several clinically relevant drug interactions that may occur during concomitant administration of IF with drugs and other compounds that modulate hepatic P450 enzyme levels.<br /><em>Modulation of P450-dependent ifosfamide pharmacokinetics: a better understanding of drug activation in vivo.

<div>Oral rifampicin given twice daily for 6 days, starting 3 days before intravenous ifosfamide (as a 24-hour infusion), increased the clearance of ifosfamide by over 100%; however, exposure to metabolites of ifosfamide was relatively unchanged.

Pre-treatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window.

<p>Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of imatinib, increased imatinib oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased mean Cmax and AUC. Similar findings were observed in patients receiving 400-1200 mg/day imatinib concomitantly with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone). The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED&#8217;s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. Concomitant administration of imatinib and St. John&#8217;s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib. Consider alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential in patients when rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib doses up to 1200 mg/day (600 mg BID) have been given to patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib.

                    <span><div>When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I. Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

No further cilastatin appeared in the urine thereafter. Approximately 10% was found as the N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase comparable to that of cilastatin. Activity of dehydropeptidase-I in the kidney returned to normal levels shortly after the elimination of cilastatin from the blood stream.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Clinical Guidance states that the use of copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is the most effective method for emergency contraception in women receiving an enzyme-inducing drug and that women who are not eligible for Cu-IUD should be offered a total of 3 mg levonorgestrel as a single dose for emergency contraception.

This interaction has been attributed to the induction of glucuronidation thereby increasing elimination of levothyroxine. Etravirine could possibly induce glucuronidation.

<p>The mean systemic exposure (AUC) of etravirine was reduced after co-administration of etravirine with lopinavir/ritonavir (tablet). Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and lopinavir/ritonavir can be co-administered without dose adjustments. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg tablets twice daily) and etravirine was studied in 16 subjects. Etravirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 30%, 35%, and 45%, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of etravirine (1600 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in HIV- subjects. Coadministration increase etravirine AUC (17%), Cmax (15%) and Cmin (23%). Lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 19%, 15% and 8% respectively; there was no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics.

<p><strong>Lopinavir/Saquinavir/Ritonavir</strong><br />The effect of adding etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) to a regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus saquinavir (800 or 1000 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration had no statistically significant effect on saquinavir AUC (13% decrease), Cmax (15% decrease) or Cmin (13% decrease). Similarly, ritonavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered (13% decrease in AUC, 11% decrease in Cmax, 12% decrease in Cmin). However, there was a statistically significant decrease in lopinavir AUC (18%) and Cmax (16%), but the decrease in Cmin (24%) was not significant.

The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>Coadministration with methadone to patients on stable methadone therapy (60-130 mg once daily) had no effect on etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin when compared to historical controls. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of R(-) methadone increased by 6%, 2% and 10%, respectively, but the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of S(+) methadone all decreased by 11%.

<p>Etravirine and methadone can be co-administered without dose adjustments, however, clinical monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. Coadministration of methadone (60-130 mg/day) and etravirine was studied in 16 methadone-maintained subjects. Cmax, AUC and Cmin of R methadone increased by 2%, 6% and 10%, respectively; Cmax, AUC and Cmin of S methadone all decreased by 11%. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of etravirine (100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methadone was investigated in 16 HIV- subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy. Pharmacokinetics of the R and S isomers of methadone were determined when given alone and after 7 and 14 days of coadministration with etravirine. Etravirine had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of methadone. At day 14 AUC, Cmax and Cmin of R (-) methadone increased by 6%, 2% and 10%, respectively; AUC, Cmax and Cmin of S (+) methadone all decreased by 11%. The pharmacokinetics of etravirine were comparable to historical controls. No clinically significant withdrawal symptoms were observed and no dose adjustment of methadone was required. <br /><em>Lack of interaction between TMC125 and methadone.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Neostigmine undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterase and is also metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

It is rapidly and extensively metabolised and relatively low concentrations of nifurtimox appear in the plasma and tissues. It is presumed to cross the blood-brain barrier.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.035 mg once daily) and norethindrone (1 mg once daily) had no effect on etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin when compared to historical controls. Ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 22%, 33% and 9%, respectively; norethindrone AUC, decreased by 5%, Cmax increased by 5% and Cmin decreased by 22%.

<p>The interaction between etravirine and oral contraceptives was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of etravirine with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (35 &#181;g once daily) and norethindrone (1 mg once daily) was studied in 16 women. Ethinyl estradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 33%, 22% and 9%, respectively, Norethindrone Cmax increased by 5%, and AUC and Cmin decreased by 5% and 22%. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of steady state TMC125 (200 mg twice daily) on pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol (35 &#181;g once daily) and norethindrone (1 mg once daily) was studied in 30 HIV- females. Coadministration of TMC125 increased ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 22%, 33% and 9%, respectively. Norethindrone AUC decreased by 5%, Cmax increased by 5% and Cmin decreased by 22%. These changes are not considered clinically relevant and no loss in contraceptive efficacy is expected when TMC125 is coadministered. <br /><em>No effect of TMC125 on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives.

<p>The interaction between etravirine and omeprazole was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. In healthy subjects, the absorption of etravirine was not affected by omeprazole, a drug that increases gastric pH. Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) and etravirine to 18 subjects increased etravirine Cmax and AUC by 17% and 41%. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of steady-state omeprazole and ranitidine on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of etravirine was evaluated in 19 HIV- subjects. Ranitidine slightly decreased etravirine exposure (AUC decreased by 14%), whereas omeprazole increased AUC by approximately 41%. The increased exposure of etravirine with omeprazole is attributed to CYP2C19 inhibition. However, due to the favourable safety profile of etravirine, these changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. The authors recommend that etravirine can be co-administered with proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists without dose adjustments.<br /><em>A pharmacokinetic study of etravirine (TMC125) co-administered with ranitidine and omeprazole in HIV-volunteers.

The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Primaquine is metabolised mainly through a non-CYP mediated mechanism and only a small fraction of the drug is believed to be metabolised through CYP450. The oxidative metabolites (formed through metabolism by CYPs 2E1, 2B6, 2D6, 3A4 and 1A2) rather than the parent drug are primarily responsible for the haemolytic effects of primaquine. Etravirine could potentially increase the amount of haemotoxic metabolites. Caution should be used when combining these drugs.</span>

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Four cases in HIV+ subjects have been reported recently where lower than anticipated raltegravir concentrations were observed when given with etravirine. The first case had raltegravir trough concentrations of 189 and 313 ng/ml on two occasions whilst on darunavir/ritonavir, enfuvirtide and raltegravir. After switching enfuvirtide for etravirine, raltegravir trough concentrations decreased to 10 ng/ml and then to 5 ng/ml one month later. The second case started a combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine, etravirine and raltegravir. Tenofovir trough concentrations were in the expected range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were considered low (30 ng/ml). Increasing raltegravir from 800 mg/day to 1200 mg/day resulted in an increase in trough concentration (67 ng/ml). The third case had low raltegravir trough concentrations on two occasions (12 and 9 ng/ml) whilst receiving darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and raltegravir. The final case switched to tenofovir, etravirine and raltegravir. Etravirine trough concentrations were within the normal range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were low (29 ng/ml). In all these cases, raltegravir concentrations were below the mean trough concentration previously observed in initial clinical trials (63 ng/ml, range 29-118 ng/ml; Markovitz et al, JAIDS, 2006, 43: 509-515). In two of the cases, concentrations were below the in vitro IC95 for raltegravir of 14.6 ng/ml. <br /><em>Etravirine-raltegravir, a marked interaction in HIV-1 infected patients: about four cases.

<p>As raltegravir is primarily glucuronidated and TMC125 induces glucuronidation, an interaction study was performed in HIV- subjects (n=19) with raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and TMC125 (200 mg twice daily). Raltegravir had no significant effect on TMC125 pharmacokinetics (increases in AUC by 10%, Cmax by 4%, Cmin by 17%). Raltegravir exposure was decreased by 10% (AUC), 11% (Cmax) and 34% (Cmin), possibly via induction of glucuronidation. Coadministration was generally safe and well tolerated and no dose adjustment is necessary in HIV+ subjects. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor TMC125 and integrase inhibitor raltegravir in healthy subjects.

<p>The effect of steady-state omeprazole and ranitidine on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of etravirine was evaluated in 19 HIV- subjects. Ranitidine slightly decreased etravirine exposure (AUC decreased by 14%), whereas omeprazole increased AUC by approximately 41%. The increased exposure of etravirine with omeprazole is attributed to CYP2C19 inhibition. However, due to the favourable safety profile of etravirine, these changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. The authors recommend that etravirine can be co-administered with proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists without dose adjustments.<br /><em>A pharmacokinetic study of etravirine (TMC125) co-administered with ranitidine and omeprazole in HIV-volunteers.

<p>The effect of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for 11 days) on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine (100 mg single dose) were investigated in 19 HIV- subjects.

Short-term etravirine coadministration with rifabutin was well tolerated. Etravirine can be coadministered with 300 mg of rifabutin once daily in the absence of an additional potent cytochrome P450 inducer.&nbsp;<br><em>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the interaction between etravirine and rifabutin or clarithromycin in HIV-negative, healthy volunteers: results from two Phase 1 studies.

<p>Coadministration of etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) was studied in 16 HIV- subjects. Coadministration decreased etravirine AUC and Cmax (both by 37%) and decreased Cmin by 35%. Rifubutin AUC, Cmax and Cmin were decreased by 17%, 10% and 24%, respectively, with exposure of the metabolite, 25 O-desacetyl rifabutin, decreasing by 17% (AUC), 15% (Cmax) and 22% (Cmin). The authors state that the decrease in rifabutin and metabolite AUC is not clinically relevant and that the decrease in etravirine exposure is comparable to that seen with boosted PIs in Phase II trials. Rifabutin and etravirine can be coadministered without dose adjustments, but the effect of all coadministered drugs should be taken into account. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Pharmacokinetic interaction between TMC125 and rifabutin.

<p>A case report described two patients successfully treated with etravirine and rifampicin. Patient 1 received rifampicin (450 mg, once daily), ethambutol (400 mg, twice daily), pyrazinamide (1,000 mg, once daily) and isoniazid (replaced by moxifloxacin 400 mg, once daily, after 4 weeks because of isoniazid resistance), followed one week later with ARVs (tenofovir/emtricitabine 300/100 mg once daily, etravirine 200 mg twice daily). Patient 2 was stable on tenofovir/emtricitabine (300/100 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) and switched darunavir/ritonavir for etravirine (200 mg twice daily) when starting rifampicin (600 mg once daily), ethambutol (400 mg three times a day), pyrazinamide (500 mg three times a day) and isoniazid (300 mg once daily). A large increase in etravirine exposure was observed in both patients (+13279 and +8325 ng h/mL, respectively) after discontinuation of rifampicin. Etravirine measured in the two CSF samples obtained from the first patient was undetectable. Despite clinical success, the etravirine plasma levels were significantly reduced by rifampicin co-administration. However, the etravirine plasma concentrations were always well above the IC50(0.39–2.4 ng/mL), and HIV-RNA suppression was achieved/maintained in both patients.<br><em>Pharmacokinetics of etravirine in HIV-infected patients concomitantly treated with rifampin for tuberculosis.

Coadministration of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) and etravirine was studied in 11 subjects and decreased etravirine Cmax and AUC by 32% and 46%, respectively. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>

<p>Etravirine should not be co-administered with PIs without low-dose ritonavir. Concomitant use of etravirine with PIs without coadministration of low-dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentrations of the PI. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) of etravirine was reduced when etravirine was co-administered with saquinavir/ritonavir. Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of saquinavir/ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and saquinavir/ritonavir can be co-administered without any dose adjustments. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lopinavir/Saquinavir/Ritonavir</strong><br />The effect of adding etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) to a regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus saquinavir (800 or 1000 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration had no statistically significant effect on saquinavir AUC (13% decrease), Cmax (15% decrease) or Cmin (13% decrease). Similarly, ritonavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered (13% decrease in AUC, 11% decrease in Cmax, 12% decrease in Cmin). However, there was a statistically significant decrease in lopinavir AUC (18%) and Cmax (16%), but the decrease in Cmin (24%) was not significant. The authors conclude that the changes in plasma PI concentrations are unlikely to be clinically significant. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of adding TMC125 to stable regimens of saquinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and NRTI in HIV+ adults.

<p>The effect of etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil (50 mg single dose) was studied in 15 HIV- subjects. Coadministration decreased sildenafil AUC by 57% and Cmax by 45%; N-desmethyl sildenafil AUC decreased by 41% and Cmax by 25%. Etravirine pharmacokinetics were similar to historical controls. Etravirine and sildenafil may be coadministered, but dose adjustment of sildenafil may be required according to clinical response. The effect of all coadministered drugs should be taken into account when determining the dose of sildenafil. <br /><em>Effect of TMC125 on sildenafil pharmacokinetics.

Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>The influence on the metabolism of phenytoin of some sulfonamides given in common clinical doses was studied. In single dose experiments sulfaphenazole increased phenytoin half-life (T/2) by 237% and decreased phenytoin metabolic clearance rate (MCR) by 67%. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethiazole, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim and trimethoprim increased phenytoin T/2 by 80, 66, 39 and 51% respectively, and decreased phenytoin MCR by 45, 36, 27 and 30% respectively. Sulfamethoxazole gave a small but significant increase in phenytoin T/2 but not a corresponding fall in phenytoin MCR. No changes were found in phenytoin T/2 and MCR after treatment with sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxydiazine. Steady state experiments confirmed the findings of the single dose experiments. It is suggested that sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim and trimethoprim inhibit hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.<br /><em>The effect of different sulfonamides on phenytoin metabolism in man.

<p>Etravirine is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 followed by glucuronidation of the metabolites by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT). Co-administration of etravirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may decrease the clearance of etravirine and may result in increased plasma concentrations of etravirine. Etravirine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Etravirine is also a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Co-administration with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 or transported by P-glycoprotein may result in increased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect or alter their adverse events profile.<br /><em>Intelence&#174; (Etravirine) 200mg tablets UK Summary of product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, updated March 2012</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but could potentially decrease the levels of tamoxifen and metabolites via induction of CYP3A4 and thereby reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen induces CYP3A4 and could potentially decrease etravirine exposure. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. Coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of cytochromes, markedly reduced tamoxifen and its metabolites concentrations and a similar effect may be expected with etravirine.</span>

No significant effect on tenofovir and etravirine PK parameters is seen. Coadministration with tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) increased tenofovir AUC (15%), Cmax (15%) and Cmin (19%). Etravirine AUC and Cmax decreased by 19% and Cmin decreased by 18%. Etravirine and tenofovir can be used without dose adjustments. <br />
<em>Intelence Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, March 2012.</em>
<p>The interaction between etravirine and tenofovir-DF was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and etravirine was studied in 23 subjects. Etravirine Cmax and AUC decreased by 19%, and Cmin decreased by 18%. Data from 19 subjects showed that tenofovir Cmax and AUC increased by 15% and Cmin increased by 19%.<br />
<em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of etravirine were determined at weeks 4 and 24 in a pharmacokinetic substudy of both DUET trials, and the effect of concomitant tenofovir-DF on etravirine AUC or trough concentration assessed. Data were available from 25 HIV+ subjects at week 4 and 23 HIV+ subjects at week 28. Tenofovir decreased etravirine AUC by 26%. <br />

<p>Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and etravirine (200 mg twice daily) was studied in 24 HIV- subjects. When combined with tenofovir-DF, etravirine AUC and Cmax both decreased by 19%, and Cmin decreased by 18%. Tenofovir AUC and Cmax both increased by 15%, and Cmin increased by 19%. The changes were not considered to be clinically relevant and the drugs can be co-administered without dose modifications. <br />

Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for etravirine to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme induction. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range.</span>

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased etravirine plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As etravirine is an inducer of CYP450 enzymes, there may be potential to decrease levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

After parenteral administration it is excreted almost completely as microbiologically active substance (approx. 75-90% within 24 hours) through glomerular filtration via the kidneys. Biliary excretion is insignificant (less than 5% of a dose). The clearance of vancomycin from plasma correlates nearly with the glomerular filtration rate. No vancomycin metabolites have been identified so far in humans<br /><em>Vancomycin, 500 mg, powder for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Limited, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p>In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/hr, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/hr. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg.

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<div>A case report describes a 54-year-old HIV-positive Caucasian male receiving darunavir/ritonavir (900/100 mg once daily) with etravirine (200 mg twice daily) and tenofovir/emtricitabine who was treated for Aspergillus fumigatus with voriconazole 400 mg i.v. twice daily (days 1-7), caspofungin 50 mg i.v. daily (days 8-25) and voriconazole 400 mg orally twice daily (days 12-45).&nbsp; Etravirine, darunavir and ritonavir were continued; however, tenofovir/emtricitabine was stopped due to acute renal failure (replaced by abacavir/lamivudine). The patient responded to antifungal therapy with no hepatic or visual toxicity and was discharged after 46 days hospitalization.&nbsp; Trough concentrations of voriconazole, etravirine, darunavir and ritonavir were measured after 3 weeks on oral voriconazole therapy and repeated 3 weeks after voriconazole discontinuation.&nbsp; Voriconazole concentrations were at the upper end of the therapeutic range, but etravirine trough concentrations increased by 134% when on voriconazole.&nbsp; Ritonavir trough concentration was undetectable and darunavir trough concentration was below the historical reference Cmin while receiving voriconazole. The authors postulate that low ritonavir exposure resulted in diminished darunavir boosting, or that the increased etravirine concentration led to a greater induction effect on darunavir. After voriconazole discontinuation, ritonavir Ctrough increased to the same range as the historical control and darunavir increased 4-fold. <br /><em>Drug interactions between voriconazole, darunavir/ritonavir and etravirine in an HIV-infected patient with Aspergillus pneumonia.
