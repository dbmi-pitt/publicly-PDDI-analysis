                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. A clinical study with ritonavir suggests there is potential for levels of albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide to be reduced when co-administered with ritonavir, potentially lowering clinical effect of albendazole.

The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but may result in decreased efficacy, especially in the treatment of systemic helminth infections. Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

                    <span>An intravenous (IV) single-bolus injection of alcuronium (0.25 mg/kg = ED95) was administered to 10 patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery during nitrous-oxide opioid anesthesia. Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

<p>Kaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A. Kaletra should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events. These medicinal products include amiodarone. Coadministration is likely to result in&nbsp;increased plasma concentrations of amiodarone. Thereby, increasing the risk of arrhythmias or other serious adverse reactions. <br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>

The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

<p>Data from two clinical studies, investigating the influence of the HIV drugs efavirenz, nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the antimalarial drugs lumefantrine, artemether and their respective metabolites, in HIV infected patients were pooled and analyzed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. Efavirenz and nevirapine significantly decreased lumefantrine exposure by ~70% and ~25% respectively while lopinavir/ritonavir substantially increased lumefantrine exposure (increase of 439%). All antiretroviral drugs decreased the total exposure to dihydroartemisinin (decrease of 71.7%, 41.3% and 59.7% for efavirenz, nevirapine and ritonavir/lopinavir, respectively). Simulations suggest that a substantially increased artemether-lumefantrine dose is required to achieve equivalent exposures when co-administered with efavirenz (250% increase) and nevirapine (75% increase). When co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir it is unclear if the increased lumefantrine exposure compensates adequately for the reduced dihydroartemisinin exposure and thus whether dose adjustment is required.<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Artemether-lumefantrine co-administration with antiretrovirals: population pharmacokinetics and dosing implications.&nbsp;Hoglund RM, Byakika-Kibwika P, Lamorde M, et al.

<p>The coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 twice daily) and the antimalarial drugs artemether/lumefantrine (80/480 mg twice daily) was studied in 10 HIV- subjects. The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir significantly increased lumefantrine AUC by 2.3-fold and there was trend towards increased Cmax (1.4-fold). Trends towards decreased AUC (39%) and Cmax (22%) were observed with artemether pharmacokinetics, whilst there was a significant decrease in the AUC and Cmax (45% and 36%, respectively) of the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir were not significantly altered and there was a non-significant increase in ritonavir exposure. The authors conclude that the results suggest the coadministration of artemether/lumefantrine and lopinavir/ritonavir can be carried out safely, though a formal safety analysis should be addressed in coinfected subjects. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Lopinavir/ritonavir affects pharmacokinetic exposure of artemether/lumefantrine in HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers..

                    <span><p>Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients.<br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The impact on the PR interval of coadministration of Kaletra with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, coadministration of Kaletra with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>The co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir and other protease inhibitors has not been studied, but would be expected to increase exposure to other protease inhibitors. Therefore, such co-administration is not recommended. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>

<p>This phase I, open-label, 3-period, fixed sequence pharmacokinetic study was in healthy volunteers (n=15). Period I was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily); period II was atazanavir (300 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily); period III was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the last day of each dosing period. The main findings were:<br />Atazanavir Cmin was 45% higher in period II vs period I, AUC did not differ and there was a trend to lower Cmax. <br />The additional ritonavir in period III did not significantly increase atazanavir Cmin, AUC or Cmax compared to period II. <br />The additional ritonavir in period III increased lopinavir Cmin by 28% compared with period II. <br />The authors conclude that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus atazanavir (300 mg once daily) gives appropriate pharmacokinetic profiles and could be further evaluated in treatment experienced patients. <br /><em>Beneficial pharmacokinetic interaction between atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. Pham PA, Flexner C, Parsons T, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007, 45(2): 201-205. </em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and atazanavir were determined in 16 HIV+ subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and atazanavir (300 mg once daily). Values were compared to HIV+ historical controls receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=15), saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (1000/400/100 mg twice daily, n=25) or atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily, n=15). Lopinavir plasma concentrations were higher when given with atazanavir, than when given alone or with saquinavir (AUC 115.7 vs 85.2 vs 85.1 &#181;g/ml.h; Cmax 12.2 vs 9.5 vs 10.0 &#181;g/ml; Cmin 9.1 vs 5.6 vs 5.5 &#181;g/ml). No difference was observed when atazanavir was given with lopinavir/ritonavir vs alone for AUC (48.2 vs 45.2 &#181;g/ml.h) and Cmax (3.95 vs 4.44 &#181;g/ml); however Cmin was higher when given with lopinavir/ritonavir (1.07 vs 0.58 &#181;g/ml). The increase in atazanavir Cmin is likely to be due to the additional dose of ritonavir when given twice daily with lopinavir. <br /><em>Atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir: pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of a promising double-boosted protease inhibitor regimen.

<p>The effect of adding lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) to atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) or adding atazanavir (300 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was investigated in HIV-infected subjects. For patients initially receiving atazanavir/ritonavir once daily, ritonavir was stopped and lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily added, thus doubling the daily dose of ritonavir. The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir had no effect on atazanavir AUC (53899 vs 49197 ng/ml.h, alone vs combination), Cmax (3996 vs 3425 ng/ml) or Cmin (860 vs 796 ng/ml). The addition of atazanavir to lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in non-significant decreases in lopinavir AUC (85415 vs 70057 ng/ml.h,. alone vs combination) and Cmax (9096 vs 7505 ng/ml), but significantly decreased lopinavir Cmin (4049 vs 2840 ng/ml). The clinical significance of the decreased lopinavir exposure is unknown and warrants further investigation. <br /><em>Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir-lopinavir combination: a pharmacokinetic interaction study of total, unbound plasma and cellular exposures.

<p>HIV+ subjects taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) added in atazanavir (300 mg once daily) on day 1 and pharmacokinetics over 12 hours were determined on day 7. Atazanavir was then stopped and after a 14-day washout, pharmacokinetic sampling for lopinavir repeated. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly different when lopinavir was taken with or without atazanavir. Atazanavir Cmin values were similar to historical controls. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) coadministered with atazanavir (ATV) in HIV infected subjects.

This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5.

However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

<div>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

<div>Coadministration of bosentan (125 mg twice daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) alone or in combination for 9.5 days was investigated in a three-way crossover study in 12 HIV-negative subjects. Bosentan did not affect lopinavir and ritonavir AUC to a clinically relevant extent (decreases of 14% and 17%, respectively) and there was no significant change in Cmax for either drug. The pharmacokinetics of bosentan were strongly affected by coadministration: bosentan concentrations increased up to 48-fold during the first 4 days of coadministration. At steady state, bosentan AUC and Cmax increased by 5.22-fold and 6.12-fold, respectively. The increased exposure to bosentan was reflected in an increase in adverse events attributed to bosentan, that is, mainly headache, but not in liver enzyme abnormalities. It is anticipated that all ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors will have a similar effect on bosentan pharmacokinetics. <br /><em>Mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between bosentan and lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy participants.

<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers.

<p>Concurrent administration of bupropion with Kaletra may decrease plasma levels of both bupropion and its active metabolite (hydroxybupropion). Patients receiving Kaletra and bupropion concurrently should be monitored for an adequate clinical response to bupropion. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>The possible interaction between single doses of sustained-release bupropion (100 mg) and lopinavir/r (400/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) was investigated in 12 HIV-negative subjects. Pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion (an active metabolite) were determined on days 1 (alone) and 30 (with LPV/r); pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/r were determined on days 29 (alone) and 30 (with bupropion). Coadministration of lopinavir/r resulted in significant decreases (57%, P&lt;0.01) for both bupropion Cmax and AUC. Decreases were also observed for hydroxybupropion (31% decrease in Cmax and 50% decrease in AUC). The pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir were not significantly changed by a single dose of bupropion (4-7% decrease in lopinavir exposure; 12-15% decrease in ritonavir exposure). The authors suggest that decreased exposure to both bupropion and the active metabolite may necessitate as much as a 100% increase in dose of bupropion. <br /><em>Lopinavir/ritonavir reduces bupropion plasma concentrations in healthy subjects.

                    <span><p>When administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone, used cautiously, is recommended. When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4, e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort, an adjustment of the dosage of buspirone may be necessary to maintain buspirone&#8217;s anxiolytic effect.<br /><em>Buspirone Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, August 2012.</em></p>
<p>Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone or certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Consequently, when administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended. When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4 the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect.<br /><em>Buspar Prescribing Information, Bristol Myers Squibb, November 2010.</em></p></span>

Kaletra must not be administered once daily in combination with carbamazepine.<br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of anticonvulsants, such a carbamazepine, may result in decreased concentrations of lopinavir. Kaletra may be less effective due to decreased plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly and should be used with caution. Kaletra should not be administered ONCE DAILY in combination with carbamazepine. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>A case was reported of a 50 year HIV+ man who developed excessive drowsiness following the introduction of lopinavir/ritonavir and it was found that his serum carbamazepine concentration had increased by 46%. The protease inhibitor was changed to nelfinavir, but within 3 days excessive drowsiness had developed, this time with an increase of 53% in serum carbamazepine concentrations. Decreasing the carbamazepine dose by 33% resulted in the resolution of symptoms on both instances. <br /><em>Carbamezepine toxicity induced by lopinavir/ritonavir and nelfinavir. Bates DE, Herman RJ.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between Kaletra and ciclosporin was investigated in 3 HIV+ patients after liver transplant; ciclosporin pharmacokinetics were available in 2/3 patients prior to starting Kaletra and in all three patients 3-6 weeks after starting Kaletra. Prior to Kaletra, ciclosporin pharmacokinetic showed typical absorption and elimination characteristics (Tmax ~1 h, half-life 4-6 h) and were comparable to those obtained in HIV- subjects. Following the addition of LPV/RTV (400/100 mg twice daily), a marked alteration in the ciclosporin pharmacokinetic plasma profile was observed - absorption/elimination curves were flattened and there was little variation in concentrations over the 12 h profile. Tmax was delayed, Cmax reduced and half-life prolonged up to 38 h. To maintain target ciclosporin trough concentrations (75-125 ng/ml), dose reductions to 5-20% of the original dose were required. <br /><em>Management of drug-to-drug interactions between cyclosporine A and the protease-inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir in liver-transplanted HIV-infected patients.

No significant differences in lopinavir concentrations at any week were observed between patients receiving twice daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=45) or with an acid reducing agent (n=7). For patients receiving once daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=86) or with an acid reducing agent (n=8), no significant difference were observed, with the exception of higher lopinavir concentrations at week 24 for patients on acid reducing agents. Similar trends were observed for ritonavir.

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

<div>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by two pathways. Activation (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is catalyzed by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. In theory, lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway which may increase the efficacy and the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Careful monitoring of cyclophosphamide related side effects is recommended.</span>

Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<div>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></div>

<div>Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of treatment with daunorubicin hydrochloride and may include: dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities (ST-T wave changes, low voltage QRS complex, T waves). Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, endomyocardial fibrosis, pericarditis/myocarditis have also been reported. Careful monitoring of cardiac function before, during and after treatment is therefore recommended in order to identify the risk of cardiac complications as early as possible. Risk factors for cardiac toxicity include active or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/ pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility; or cardiotoxic drugs.<br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em>

<div>Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients. Particular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin. Indeed, Kaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in an increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. Cardiac events have been reported with Kaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently ruled out<br /><em>Kaletra&#174; (lopinavir/ritonavir) 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Limited, updated September 2012</em></div></div></span>

Appropriate doses of the combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established.<br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>Delavirdine has the potential to increase concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir. Appropriate doses of delavirdine and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) with respect to safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics have not been established. <br /><em>Rescriptor Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012. <br /></em></p>
<p>The effect of switching from nevirapine or efavirenz to delavirdine or adding delavirdine was evaluated in a clinical setting in 15 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (with or without other PIs). In 8 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir, the presence of delavirdine increased the AUC of lopinavir by 33% (7-134%). The tolerability of delavirdine containing regimens was a frequent problem resulting in drug discontinuation in 5/15 patients. <br /><em>Delavirdine effects on exposure to ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors.

<p>
<p>The effect of delavirdine (600 mg bd) on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 or 266/66 mg bd) was studied in 26 healthy volunteers. When compared to the standard dose of lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone, the addition of delavirdine resulted in increases in lopinavir Cmin, AUC and Cmax of 53%, 24% and 13%. The lower dose of lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in reduced lopinavir exposure by ~25% when compared to the standard dose alone. Ritonavir exposure was increased by ~50% in the presence of delavirdine. Delavirdine exposure was decreased by ~25-30%. In the presence of delavirdine, the lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg regimen was not as well tolerated as the 266/66 mg regimen. Further clinical studies are needed to determine if optimal safety and efficacy are achieved with reduced dose or full dose lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with delavirdine. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between delavirdine, lopinavir and ritonavir during coadministration in healthy volunteers.

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

<p>A 40 year old HIV patient on a lopinavir/ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen was commenced on docetaxel-containing chemotherapy (25 mg/m2 IV weekly). Eight days after the first infusion he developed neutropaenic fever; the docetaxel was discontinued and the antiretroviral regimen was unchanged. The authors postulate that ritonavir may have decreased docetaxel clearance through inhibition of CYP3A4, resulting in acute docetaxel toxicity. <br /><em>Possible pharmacokinetic interaction involving ritonavir and docetaxel in a patient with Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma.

Neither lopinavir nor ritonavir pharmacokinetics were altered by coadministration of echinacea (lopinavir AUC decrease by 4% and there was no change in Cmax).

<p>The effect of echinacea on CYP activity was assessed by use of a number of CYP probe drugs (caffeine for CYP1A2; tolbutamide for CYP2C9; dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A) in a study in 12 healthy volunteers. The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted. Certainly echinacea could contribute to inter-patient variability in protease inhibitor levels. <br /><em>The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) root on cytochrome P450 activity in vivo.

<p>Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with efavirenz. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with efavirenz. The recommended dose of Kaletra tablets is 500/125 mg twice daily (such as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet). The recommended dose of Kaletra oral solution is 533/133 mg twice daily taken with food. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 500/125 (given as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in similar lopinavir concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg (given as two 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily without efavirenz. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 600/150 mg (given as three 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in significantly higher lopinavir plasma concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg once daily for 9 days) to 11 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 3%, 19% and 39% respectively, when compared to data from 7 subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone. Efavirenz Cmax decreased by 9% and AUC and Cmin both decreased by 16% (compared to data from 12 subjects receiving efavirenz alone). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (500/125 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 19 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose increased lopinavir Cmax (12%) and AUC (6%), and decreased Cmin (10%). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (600/150 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 23 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose resulted in increased lopinavir Cmax (36%), AUC (36%) and Cmin (32%).

<p>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir capsules and efavirenz resulted in a substantial decrease in lopinavir exposure. With efavirenz, an increase of the lopinavir/ritonavir capsule or oral solution doses by 33% should be considered (4 capsules/~6.5 ml twice daily instead of 3 capsules/5 ml twice daily). Caution is warranted since this dosage adjustment might be insufficient in some patients. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased lopinavir concentrations by 30-40%. When lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (500/125 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were coadministered, lopinavir concentrations were similar to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. The dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets should be increased to 500/125 mg twice daily when coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>

<p>Two prospective, open-label, non-randomized studies evaluated amprenavir and lopinavir steady-state pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients on a background of nucleosides and amprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (750/533/133 mg twice daily) with (n=7) or without (n=12) efavirenz (Study 1) and after switching from amprenavir to fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily, n=10; Study 2). Efavirenz did not significantly alter amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetic parameters in patients taking amprenavir/lopinavir.

<p>A dose increase to 533/133 mg was advised when lopinavir/ritonavir capsules were coadministered with efavirenz. As this dose increase is not possible with the new tablet formulation (200/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per tablet), the coadministration of 2 tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 21 HIV- subjects. Subjects received 3 lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) followed by 2 lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with efavirenz for 10 days. Lopinavir PK parameters were determined on days 10 (3 capsules alone) and 20 (2 tablets + EFV). Mean (&#177; sd) lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values on day 10 were 11.8&#177;3.3 &#181;g/ml, 95.7&#177;33.7 &#181;g.h/ml and 6.8&#177;3.3 &#181;g/ml, respectively. Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values obtained on day 20 were 10.5&#177;4.0 &#181;g/ml, 84.9&#177;17.8 &#181;g.h/ml and 5.0&#177;2.7 &#181;g/ml, respectively. Coadministration of efavirenz with the lopinavir/ritonavir tablet decreased lopinavir AUC and Ctrough by ~20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the capsule formulation administered alone. The concentrations obtained with the tablet + EFV were within the range of concentrations previously demonstrated to be efficacious in clinical trials. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir after multiple dose administration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablet coadministered with efavirenz.

<p>As the new lopinavir/ritonavir tablet is a fixed dose combination of 200/50 mg (the capsule dose is 133/33 mg), a dose increase to 533/133 mg when lopinavir/ritonavir is coadministered with efavirenz will not be possible. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (600/150 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily). When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) given alone, lopinavir Cmax and AUC were moderately increased (36%); ritonavir Cmax increased 92% and ritonavir AUC increased 78%. The regimens were generally well tolerated. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic effect of efavirenz on a new tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; NVP n=9, EFV n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. <br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

<p>The coadministration of efavirenz with 2 NRTIs (n=19) or with 2 NRTIs plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100-532/132 mg twice daily, n=40) was studied in treatment experienced patients.

<p>The steady-state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 and 533/133 mg twice daily) when dosed in combination with efavirenz, plus two NRTIs, were assessed in 57 multiple PI-experienced but NNRTI-naive HIV+ subjects. When codosed with efavirenz, the 400/100 mg regimen resulted in lower lopinavir concentrations, (trough concentration = 3.66&#177;2.64 &#181;g/ml) than were observed in previous studies of lopinavir/ritonavir administered without efavirenz. Increasing the lopinavir/ritonavir dose to 533/133 mg increased lopinavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 46, 33, and 141%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values were increased by 48, 46 and 63%, respectively. The lopinavir trough concentration (5.88&#177;5.53 &#181;g/ml) achieved with the 533/133 mg dose was similar to historical data obtained with lopinavir/r 400/100 mg in the absence of efavirenz (5.49&#177;4.02 &#181;g/ml). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of lopinavir-ritonavir in combination with efavirenz and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in extensively pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

<p>The coadministration of efavirenz to 4 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in lopinavir Cmin values of 7625 (2870-11200) ng/ml and Cmax values of 14100 (3990-17300) ng/ml. Mean lopinavir concentrations in a group of patients (n=4) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone were 5690 (1420-11120) ng/ml for Cmin and 12400 (3920-17300) ng/ml for Cmax.

<p>An interaction study of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) and efavirenz was performed in healthy volunteers and HIV+ individuals all of whom received Kaletra (400 lopinavir/100 ritonavir mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). In healthy volunteers, efavirenz had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, with efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin being reduced by 16% or less in the presence of Kaletra. In healthy volunteers, efavirenz resulted in a 19% decrease in the AUC of lopinavir and a 39% decrease in the Cmin of lopinavir; there was no change in the Cmax of lopinavir. In HIV+ individuals, the decrease in lopinavir was 25% for AUC and 44% for Cmin. No dosage adjustment of efavirenz is required when administered with Kaletra. However, Kaletra should be increased by 33% from 400/100 mg to 533/133 mg when coadministered with efavirenz. <br /><em>Assessment of the pharmacokinetic interaction between ABT378/ritonavir and efavirenz in healthy volunteers and in healthy subjects.

<p><strong>Efavirenz and Lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir</strong></p>
<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir (533/133/750 mg twice daily) was investigated in 19 HIV-infected subjects. Subjects received lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir without (n=12) or with efavirenz (n=7). Lopinavir concentrations were similar to historical controls receiving lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily, while amprenavir concentrations were lower than those measured following the administration of amprenavir/ritonavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir in the absence of lopinavir, but similar to those observed in a previous pharmacokinetic study which investigated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir/fosamprenavir 533/133/1400 mg twice daily. At the doses studied in this small pilot study, efavirenz did not seem to have any inducing effect on either lopinavir or amprenavir, since when comparing drug concentrations in the two groups of subjects, no significant different was observed. However, a wider inter-individual variability in both lopinavir and amprenavir concentrations was observed in the efavirenz group. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of amprenavir, lopinavir, and efavirenz concentrations in HIV-infected patients.

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Empagliflozin is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A3, 1A8, 1A9 and 2B7. It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as ritonavir may&nbsp;reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required. An effect on concentrations of lopinavir is unlikely as empagliflozin does not inhibit or induce CYPs and does not inhibit UGTs.</p></span>

Lopinavir AUC was 19% lower after three weeks of patch application.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and etonogestrel implants increased etonogestrel exposure (52%, 61%, and 34% increases in AUC, Cmax, and Cmin, respectively) suggesting that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of etonogestrel implants. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only etonogestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

<p>Coadministration of etravirine (1600 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in HIV- subjects.

<p><strong>Lopinavir/Saquinavir/Ritonavir</strong><br />The effect of adding etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) to a regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus saquinavir (800 or 1000 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration had no statistically significant effect on saquinavir AUC (13% decrease), Cmax (15% decrease) or Cmin (13% decrease). Similarly, ritonavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered (13% decrease in AUC, 11% decrease in Cmax, 12% decrease in Cmin). However, there was a statistically significant decrease in lopinavir AUC (18%) and Cmax (16%), but the decrease in Cmin (24%) was not significant.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Fluphenazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. Lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levels of fluphenazine via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing likelihood of adverse events. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic PR prolongation in some healthy adult subjects. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.  The impact on the PR interval of coadministration with ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval has not been evaluated. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and fluphenazine should be undertaken with caution. The European SPC for fluphenazine contraindicates the concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.</span>

                    <span><p>Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients. Particular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin. Indeed, Kaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in an increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. Cardiac events have been reported with Kaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently ruled out<br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Limited, September 2012.</em></p>
<p>Fluphenazine is metabolised by P450 2D6 and is itself an inhibitor of this drug metabolising enzyme. The plasma concentrations and the effects of fluphenazine may therefore be increased and prolonged by drugs that are either the substrates or inhibitors of this P450 isoform, possibly resulting in severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects. The effects of phenothiazines on the heart are dose-related. ECG changes with prolongation of the QT interval and T-Wave changes have been reported commonly in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have also occurred after overdosage. Sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths have been reported in hospitalised psychotic patients receiving phenothiazines. The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, concurrent use of these drugs and fluphenazine is contraindicated.<br /><em>Modecate Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-aventis, December 2011.</em></p></span>

Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) increased lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 30%, 37% and 52%, respectively, but decreased amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 58%, 63% and 65%, respectively. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily) and fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) had no effect on lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin when compared to lopinavir 400/100 mg twice daily.

<p>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 twice daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) to 18 subjects resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 58%, 63% and 65%, respectively. Lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 30%, 37% and 52% respectively. Amprenavir pharmacokinetics in 18 subjects were compared after administration of fosamprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (1400/533/133 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) versus fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks). In the presence of lopinavir, amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 13%, 26% and 42%. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics in this study were compared to those obtained following lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) and were similar (less than 10% change in Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values). An increased rate of adverse events has been observed. Appropriate doses of the combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Co-administration of standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir with fosamprenavir significantly reduced amprenavir concentrations. Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400 mg twice daily with lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily to protease inhibitor experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy, when compared with standard doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir. Concomitant administration of these medicinal products is not recommended. Kaletra must not be administered once daily in combination with amprenavir.<br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with fosamprenavir. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with (fos)amprenavir. The recommended dose of Kaletra tablets is 500/125 mg twice daily (such as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet). The recommended dose of Kaletra oral solution is 533/133 mg twice daily taken with food. Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) to 18 HIV- volunteers resulted in increases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 30%, 37% and 52% respectively.

<p>Coadministration of amprenavir or fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir was investigated in an open-label study in 10 HIV+ patients. Switching from a regimen of APV/LPV/r (750/533/133 mg twice daily) to FPV/LPV/r (1400/533/133 mg twice daily) resulted in steady-state APV Cmin, AUC and Cmax increasing by 58%, 76% and 75%, respectively. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics were comparable and there was no change in tolerability. <br /><em>Amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients switched from amprenavir 750 mg bid + lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg bid to fosamprenavir 1400 mg bid + lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg bid or vice versa.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between fosamprenavir and lopinavir/ritonavir was evaluated in groups of HIV-infected subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=8), fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily, n=8) or fosamprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (700/400/100 mg twice daily, n=17). Plasma exposure to both amprenavir and lopinavir were significantly reduced when coadministered. Amprenavir mean AUC decreased by 64% (from 42731 to 17381 ng/ml.h) and Cmin decreased by 69% (from 2430 to 876 ng/ml). Lopinavir AUC decreased by 48% (from 95328 to 54384 ng/ml.h) and Cmin decreased by 61% (from 6320 to 2985 ng/ml). Ritonavir exposure was not significantly different between the groups. <br /><em>Combining fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir substantially reduces amprenavir and lopinavir exposure: ACTG protocol A5143 results.

Halofantrine has been shown to prolong QTc interval at the recommended therapeutic dose. There have been rare reports of serious ventricular dysrhythmias sometimes associated with death, which may be sudden. Halofantrine is therefore not recommended for use in combination with drugs or clinical conditions known to prolong QTc interval.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Lopinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of lopinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as lopinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), latest modification: 20-Aug-2010<br />Wagner T. Clin Pharmacokinet 1994; 26: 439&#8211;56; Boddy AV, Yule SM.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

                    <span><p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan was investigated in seven patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Coadministration reduced irinotecan clearance by 47% and was associated with an 81% decrease in the AUC of the oxidized metabolite APC. Formation of SN38 glucuronide (SN38G) was also inhibited, as shown by the 36% decrease in the SN38G/SN38 AUCs ratio consistent with UGT1A1 inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. This dual effect increased the availability of irinotecan for SN38 conversion and reduced inactivation on SN38, leading to a 204% increase in SN38 AUC in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir. The clinical consequences of these substantial pharmacokinetic changes should be investigated. <br /><em>Lopinavir-ritonavir dramatically affects the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in HIV patients with Kaposi's Sarcoma.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

<p>The interaction between itraconazole and Kaletra was described in an HIV+ patient treated for disseminated histoplasmosis. Itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) was administered for 10 days prior to the addition of Kaletra (400/100 mg twice daily); the dose of itraconazole was reduced to 200 mg once daily when Kaletra was commenced. Coadministration of itraconazole and Kaletra resulted in a strong increase in itraconazole concentrations and a decrease in hydroxyitraconazole (an equally pharmacologically active metabolite). Immediately after starting Kaletra, itraconazole concentrations remained similar to pre-Kaletra levels (Cmax ~750 ng/ml), despite the dose reduction. After 5 weeks of treatment, itraconazole Cmax was &gt;2000 ng/ml and half life had increased from 16 h to &gt;160 h. Lopinavir Cmin and Cmax values were 3.4 and 8.5 mg/L respectively, and were comparable to those obtained in HIV+ adults not receiving itraconazole. If long term maintenance treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis with itraconazole (200 mg once daily) and Kaletra (400/100 mg twice daily) is required, close monitoring of the treatment and plasma concentration is important, especially if dosages or concomitant drugs are altered. <br /><em>Drug-drug interaction between itraconazole and the antiretroviral drug lopinavir/ritonavir in an HIV-1-infected patient with disseminated histoplasmosis.

Raltegravir was prescribed on day 4.

Lopinavir, ritonavir, tenofovir and emtricitabine plasma concentrations were 8.40 mg/L, 0.29 mg/L, 0.059 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively. The lopinavir plasma concentration was higher than usual (3 to 7 mg/L); but the measurement was done only 3 days after treatment initiation while 2 weeks are required to see the maximal enzyme inducing effects of ritonavir. Tenofovir and emtricitabine plasma concentrations were in the normal range.&nbsp; Genetic analysis showed the patient to be an intermediate metaboliser for CYP2D6, a normal metaboliser for CYP3A4 and a low expressor of P-gp.

Plasma levels were determined at steady state following lamotrigine (100 mg twice daily) alone (day 10) or in combination (day 20) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). A dose increase dependent on the magnitude of decrease in lamotrigine concentrations was performed following PK analysis with further PK analysis 10 days later. The mean decrease in lamotrigine Cmin was 56%, thus all subjects received a dose increase to 200 mg twice daily. Lamotrigine AUCs on days 20 and 10 were not bioequivalent (point estimate 0.50, 95% CI 0.47-0.54), however, the dose increase restored bioequivalence on day 31 (point estimate 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.05). Lopinavir concentrations were determined in 6 subjects on day 20 and were found to be comparable with historical controls of lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC of lamotrigine, probably by induction of glucuronidation, and a dose increase of 200% was needed to overcome the interaction. From these limited data, lamotrigine does not appear to have an effect on LPV/RTV. <br /><em>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine in healthy subjects. van der Lee, M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 12.</em></p></span>

No significant differences in lopinavir concentrations at any week were observed between patients receiving twice daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=45) or with an acid reducing agent (n=7). For patients receiving once daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=86) or with an acid reducing agent (n=8), no significant difference were observed, with the exception of higher lopinavir concentrations at week 24 for patients on acid reducing agents. Similar trends were observed for ritonavir.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

The abnormal results of the thyroid hormonal tests persisted despite the increase in daily dose of levothyroxine up to 225 &#181;g/day and the introduction of liothyronine. On the basis of a possible interaction between protease inhibitors and levothyroxine, the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing HAART was withdrawn. Two months later the TSH and T4 serum concentrations had returned to normal level and remained stable.

<p>The coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 twice daily) and the antimalarial drugs artemether/lumefantrine (80/480 mg twice daily) was studied in 10 HIV- subjects. The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir significantly increased lumefantrine AUC by 2.3-fold and there was trend towards increased Cmax (1.4-fold). Trends towards decreased AUC (39%) and Cmax (22%) were observed with artemether pharmacokinetics, whilst there was a significant decrease in the AUC and Cmax (45% and 36%, respectively) of the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin.

                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

<p>Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients. Particular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin. Indeed, Kaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in an increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. Cardiac events have been reported with Kaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently ruled out<br /><em>Kaletra&#174; (lopinavir/ritonavir) 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Limited, updated September 2012</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>Coadministration of methadone (5 mg single dose) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) to 11 HIV- subjects resulted in a 45% decrease in methadone Cmax and a 53% decrease in AUC. Dosage of methadone may need to be increased when coadministered with Kaletra.<br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>Lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was commenced in 18 HIV+ patients participating in a methadone maintenance program. Median (range) methadone dose at study entry was 95 (40-130) mg/day. None of the patients experienced symptoms of opioid withdrawal, no patients requested a change in methadone dosing and there was no indication for the prescribing physician to adjust methadone dosing based on daily clinical assessment during the 28 day evaluation period after starting lopinavir/ritonavir.<br /><em>Lack of methadone dose alterations or withdrawal symptoms during therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and ritonavir alone (100 mg twice daily) on methadone was studied in 15 HIV- methadone-maintained subjects. When compared to values obtained for methadone alone, decreases in methadone Cmin, AUC and Cmax of 26, 28 and 26% respectively were observed with lopinavir/ritonavir. There was a significant increase in opiate withdrawal symptoms, the incidence of which was related to the magnitude of decrease in methadone Cmin (12% decrease &#8211; no change in withdrawal symptoms; 32% decrease &#8211; moderate increase in symptoms; 42% decrease &#8211; severe increase in symptoms). In contrast, coadministration of ritonavir produced a modest but not significant increase in methadone concentrations, and there were no increases in opiate withdrawal symptoms.<br /><em>The protease inhibitor lopinavir-ritonavir may produce opiate withdrawal in methadone-maintained patients.

<p>Methadone-stabilised (n=15) or volunteer (n=15) subjects received lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) or ritonavir alone (100 mg twice daily) for 7 days. Ritonavir AUC was increased by ~60% when coadministered with methadone (6.5 vs 11.0 mg/ml.h), but when the same dose was administered in combination with lopinavir, no significant changes in ritonavir exposure were observed (8.7 vs 7.7 mg/ml.h). Methadone did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir (AUC 84.7 vs 86.3 mg/ml.h; Cmin 4.4 vs 4.6 mg/L; Cmax 10.0 vs 9.3 mg/L; alone vs with methadone). <br /><em>Smith P, McCance-Katz E, Sarlo J, et al.

<div>A case report describes a patient stable on lacidipine, ramipril, levothyroxine, rosuvastatin, metoprolol and acetylsalicylic acid who developed extreme bradycardia (20-25 bpm) and hypotension (50/20 mmHg) 48 hours after starting HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (tenofovir, emtricitabine, lopinavir/ritonavir).&nbsp; Lopinavir/ritonavir, lacidipine, ramipril and metoprolol were discontinued. Raltegravir was prescribed on day 4. Lacidipine, ramipril were re-instated on day 7 and metoprolol on day 9.&nbsp; Blood concentrations were analyzed approximately 12 h after the last dose of tenofovir/emtricitabine and 20 h after the last dose of lopinavir/ritonavir. Lopinavir, ritonavir, tenofovir and emtricitabine plasma concentrations were 8.40 mg/L, 0.29 mg/L, 0.059 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively. The lopinavir plasma concentration was higher than usual (3 to 7 mg/L); but the measurement was done only 3 days after treatment initiation while 2 weeks are required to see the maximal enzyme inducing effects of ritonavir. Tenofovir and emtricitabine plasma concentrations were in the normal range.&nbsp; Genetic analysis showed the patient to be an intermediate metaboliser for CYP2D6, a normal metaboliser for CYP3A4 and a low expressor of P-gp. The authors propose that the AV block and the hypotension were primarily associated with co-administration of the lopinavir/ritonavir combination with metoprolol and lacidipine as the patient was asymptomatic while he started antiretroviral therapy, and discontinuation of lopinavir/ritonavir, lacidipine, ramipril and metoprolol, restored normal rhythm, and further, re-introduction of lacidipine, ramipril and metoprolol without lopinavir/ritonavir induced no bradyarrythmia. <br /><em>Extreme bradycardia due to multiple drug-drug interactions in a patient with HIV post-exposure prophylaxis containing lopinavir-ritonavir.

Kaletra must not be coadministered with ORALLY administered midazolam, whereas caution should be used with coadministration of Kaletra and PARENTERAL midazolam. If Kaletra is coadministered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.

<p>Coadministration of lopinavir and ORALLY administered midazolam is contraindicated due to the potential for prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher with oral than parenteral administration. If lopinavir is coadministered with PARENTERAL midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustment should be considered.<br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p></span>

A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form.

In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

Nateglinide is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 (70%) and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 (30%) and in vivo data indicate that ritonavir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9. The net clinical effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease nateglinide concentrations (induction CYP2C9) or increase nateglinide concentrations (inhibition CYP3A4).

<p>The aim of this study was to assess the influence of nevirapine on lopinavir pharmacokinetics in order to optimise dosing regimens. The study included 15 HIV+ subjects, who received LPV/r (533/133 mg twice daily) and NVP (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by NVP 200 mg twice daily). Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters were measured at week 4 and compared with data from patients (n=23) receiving LPV/r (400/100 mg twice daily) + 2 NRTIs. Following an increase in the LPV/r dosage, the mean &#177; sd LPV Ctrough was 5240 &#177; 4029 ng/ml, which was not significantly different from the mean Ctrough for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI (4272 &#177; 3114 ng/ml, P=0.637). No statistically significant difference was observed in the mean AUC for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI or with LPV/r 533/133 mg bid + NVP 200 mg bid (82746 &#177; 41019 vs 100940 &#177; 48871 ng.h/ml, P=0.3286). The findings suggest that an increase in LPV/r dose to 533/133 mg (4 capsules twice daily) is appropriate when co-administered with NVP. Data is awaited on the new tablet formulation of lopinavir in the presence of nevirapine. <br /><em>The steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg bid plus nevirapine (200 mg bid) in adult HIV-1-infected individuals (the NRTI sparing study).

<p>Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; nevirapine n=9, efavirenz n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. <br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

<p>The coadministration of nevirapine to 2 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in lopinavir Cmin values of 1420 and 5240 ng/ml and Cmax values of 3920 and 12300 ng/ml. Mean lopinavir concentrations in a group of patients (n=4) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone were 5690 (1420-11120) ng/ml for Cmin and 12400 (3920-17300) ng/ml for Cmax. Nevirapine concentrations were 769 and 1610 ng/ml for Cmin and 2290 and 2490 ng/ml for Cmax. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir in combination with nevirapine or efavirenz.

<p>Five HIV+ patients receiving nevirapine (200 mg bd), amprenavir (600 mg bd) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg bd) were studied. Amprenavir concentrations were in the expected ranges (Cmin 560-3090 ng/ml; Cmax 1760-8040 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 13230-75170 ng/ml.h). However, lopinavir concentrations were quite variable (Cmin 620-5980 ng/ml; Cmax 2710-12600 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 998-175140 ng/ml.h) and 40-60% lower than reported by the manufacturer. The combination of amprenavir, lopinavir and nevirapine may result in unpredictable lopinavir concentrations and pharmacological monitoring is advisable in patients treated with such combinations. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and lopinavir in combination with nevirapine in highly pretreated HIV-infected patients.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

No statistically significant effect of omeprazole on LPV exposure was observed (Cmax 9234 vs 11274 ng/ml; Cmin 4473 vs 5111 ng/ml; AUC 89.1 vs 98.5 mg.h/L; alone vs +omeprazole). Ritonavir pharmacokinetics were also unchanged in the presence of omeprazole. <br /><em>Acid reduction with a proton pump inhibitor does not affect pharmacokinetics of lopinavir or ritonavir in HIV-infected subjects in lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy.

<p>The effect of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) or ranitidine (150 mg once daily) on the lopinavir/ritonavir tablet (400/100 mg twice daily or 800/200 once daily) was assessed in HIV+ subjects. Neither omeprazole or ranitidine significantly altered lopinavir or ritonavir exposure after coadministration.<br /><em>Lack of effect of acid-reducing agents on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir tablet.

<p>The effects of gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists or anatacids) on lopinavir concentrations were assessed on 5 occasions over a 48-week period in antiretroviral na&#239;ve patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily or 800/200 mg once daily). No significant differences in lopinavir concentrations at any week were observed between patients receiving twice daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=45) or with an acid reducing agent (n=7). For patients receiving once daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=86) or with an acid reducing agent (n=8), no significant difference were observed, with the exception of higher lopinavir concentrations at week 24 for patients on acid reducing agents. Similar trends were observed for ritonavir. Further formal investigations of the effect of potent acid reducing agents on lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics are warranted. <br /><em>Lack of effect of gastric acid reducing agents on lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations in HIV-infected patients.

<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) on the metabolism of omeprazole (40 mg single dose in combination with warfarin and vitamin K) was studied in 7 healthy volunteers. Coadministration resulted in an increase in CYP2C19, leading to increased metabolism of omeprazole; the ratio of omeprazole to 5-hydroxyomeprazole decreased from 1.45&#177;0.97 to 0.46&#177;0.25. Increased doses of drugs metabolised primarily by CYP2C19 may be necessary for optimal management when given concomitantly with lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lopinavir/ritonavir induces CYP2C9 and 2C19 activity as measured by warfarin and omeprazole biomarkers in healthy human volunteers.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

In addition, coadministration of phenytoin and Kaletra may cause decreases in steady state phenytoin concentrations. Phenytoin levels should be monitored when coadministering with Kaletra. Kaletra should not be administered ONCE DAILY in combination with phenytoin. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV; 400/100 mg bd) and phenytoin (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed at steady state (study days 11 and 22). Following the addition of phenytoin, lopinavir Ctrough decreased by 46% (from 5.97 &#177; 3.17 to 3.55 &#177; 2.31 &#181;g/ml; mean &#177; sd), AUC decreased by 33% (from 70.89 &#177; 36.96 to 49.61 &#177; 25.09 &#181;g/ml.h; mean &#177; sd) and oral clearance increased from 4.79 &#177; 3.68 to 9.60 &#177; 9.76 L/h (mean &#177; sd). Concentrations of ritonavir were also decreased: Ctrough decreased from 0.28 &#177; 0.33 to 0.14 &#177; 0.15 &#181;g/ml (mean &#177; sd) and AUC decreased from 3.08 &#177; 2.79 to 1.99 &#177; 1.09 &#181;g/ml.h (mean &#177; sd). Following the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir, phenytoin Ctrough decreased by 33% (from 7.04 &#177; 4.02 to 5.31 &#177; 4.05 &#181;g/ml; mean &#177; sd), AUC decreased by 31% (from 191.00 &#177; 89.21 to 147.75 &#177; 104.54 &#181;g/ml.h; mean &#177; sd), and oral clearance increased from 0.61 &#177; 0.65 to 1.53 &#177; 1.95 L/h (mean &#177; sd). The decrease in lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations may be clinically significant and a dose increase to LPV/RTV 533/133 mg or addition of 100 mg extra RTV (i.e. LPV/RTV 400/200 mg) could be considered. Dose monitoring of phenytoin is recommended due to the decrease in phenytoin exposure. <br /><em>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and phenytoin results in two-way drug interaction through cytochrome P-450 induction.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

Prednisolone AUC was significantly lower in the presence of efavirenz versus lopinavir/ritonavir (GMR=0.60, p=0.01) and was higher in the subjects taking lopinavir/ritonavir than in subjects on no antiretrovirals, but this was not significant (p&gt;0.05). The authors conclude that prednisolone concentrations may fluctuate widely when patients on efavirenz switch to lopinavir/ritonavir or vice versa. <br /><em>Influence of antiretroviral drugs on the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone in HIV-infected individuals.

In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. Lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease propofol concentrations. The extent of this interaction is difficult to predict as propofol is a high hepatic extraction drug and therefore its rate of hepatic elimination is in theory more dependent on liver blood flow.

Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>The interaction between raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was determined in 12 HIV- subjects. Lopinavir had no effect on raltegravir AUC or Cmax (5.3 vs 5.4 mg/L.h and 1698 vs 1687 ng/ml, alone vs combination respectively) but decreased raltegravir Cmin by 30% (49.4 vs 34.4 ng/ml). Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were similar when given alone or with raltegravir. Despite a decrease of 30%, raltegravir Cmin remained above the estimated IC95 of 15 ng/ml, suggesting that raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can be coadministered without dose adjustments of either drug. <br /><em>RAL-KAL: Pharmacokinetics of coadministered raltegravir and lopinavir-ritonavir in healthy adults.

<p>Drug interaction studies reveal no clinically significant interaction between Kaletra and ranitidine. Coadministration of ranitidine (150 mg single dose) and Kaletra tablets (400/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 12 HIV- subjects.

<p>The effects of gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists or antacids) on lopinavir concentrations were assessed on 5 occasions over a 48-week period in antiretroviral na&#239;ve patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily or 800/200 mg once daily). No significant differences in lopinavir concentrations at any week were observed between patients receiving twice daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=45) or with an acid reducing agent (n=7). For patients receiving once daily lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=86) or with an acid reducing agent (n=8), no significant difference were observed, with the exception of higher lopinavir concentrations at week 24 for patients on acid reducing agents. Similar trends were observed for ritonavir. Further formal investigations of the effect of potent acid reducing agents on lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics are warranted. <br /><em>Lack of effect of gastric acid reducing agents on lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations in HIV-infected patients.

Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. It is released from the liver bound to a specific &#945;1-globulin (retinol-binding protein) in the blood. The retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid; these and other metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), latest modification: 05-Dec-2011</em> </p>
<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

                      <span><p>Coadministration of lopinavir/r and rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on lopinavir exposure, whereas initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed a significant increase in rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) concentrations. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r (400/100 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (150 mg 3 times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg 3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).</p></span>

<p>Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg once daily for 10 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg for 20 days) to 14 HIV- subjects resulted in increases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 8%, 17% and 20% respectively. Data in 12 subjects, and compared to rifabutin 300 mg once daily alone (for 10 days), showed increases in rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 2.1-, 3.0- and 4.9-fold. Cmax, AUC and Cmin for 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin increased by 23.6-, 47.5- and 94.9-fold. Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week).

The rifabutin dose with ART was switched after 1 month. Rifabutin AUC and Cmax in patients taking 150 mg rifabutin three times weekly was significantly reduced compared to the other treatment arms: AUC and Cmax decreased by 40% and 50% when compared to 300 mg once daily, and decreased by 60% and 50% when compared to 150 mg daily. 86% of patients on the three times weekly rifabutin arm had an AUC &lt; 4.5 μg.h/mL, which has previously been associated with acquired rifamycin resistance. Plasma d-RBT concentrations increased 5-fold with three times weekly rifabutin dosing and 15-fold with daily doses of rifabutin.

<p>A randomized, open-label, multi-dose, two-arm, cross-over trial, conducted in Vietnamese adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis evaluated rifabutin pharmacokinetics before and after the introduction of lopinavir/ritonavir. Rifabutin and 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin concentrations were measured after 2 weeks of rifabutin 300 mg daily alone, after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir (n=12) and after 3 weeks of rifabutin 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir (n=13). Rifabutin 150 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with a 32% mean increase in rifabutin average steady state concentration compared with rifabutin 300 mg alone. In contrast, the rifabutin average steady state concentration decreased by 44% when rifabutin was given at 150 mg three times per week with lopinavir/ritonavir. With both dosing regimens, 2-5 fold increases of the 25-O-desacetyl- rifabutin metabolite were observed when rifabutin was given with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with rifabutin alone. The different doses of rifabutin had no significant effect on lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations.<br></p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin before and after the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir were examined in 10 patients with HIV infection and active tuberculosis. Samples were collected 2-4 weeks after starting rifabutin (300 mg thrice weekly) without lopinavir/ritonavir, 2 weeks after the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) to rifabutin(150 mg thrice weekly), and (if rifabutin plasma concentrations were below the normal range) 2 weeks after an increase in rifabutin to 300 mg thrice weekly with lopinavir/ritonavir. Concentrations of rifabutin, the microbiologically active 25-desacetyl-rifabutin, and lopinavir were determined. Low rifabutin Cmax values were observed in 5/10 patients on rifabutin 300 mg without lopinavir/ritonavir. After the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to rifabutin 150 mg, 9/10 had low Cmax values. Eight patients had dose increases to 300 mg rifabutin with lopinavir/ritonavir. Most free rifabutin (unbound to plasma protein) Cmax values were below the tuberculosis minimal inhibitory concentration. For most patients, values for AUC were as low or lower than those associated with treatment failure or relapse and with acquired rifamycin resistance. One of the 10 patients experienced relapse with acquired rifamycin resistance. The recommended rifabutin doses for use with lopinavir/ritonavir may be inadequate in many patients.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended. Rifampicin administered with Kaletra causes large decreases in lopinavir concentrations due to CYP3A induction by rifampicin. The decrease in lopinavir concentrations may in turn significantly decrease the lopinavir therapeutic effect. A dose adjustment of Kaletra 400 mg/400 mg twice daily has allowed compensating for the CYP 3A4 inducer effect of rifampicin. However, such a dose adjustment might be associated with ALT/AST elevations and with increase in gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, this coadministration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary. If this coadministration is judged unavoidable, increased dose of Kaletra at 400 mg/400 mg twice daily may be administered with rifampicin under close safety and therapeutic drug monitoring. The Kaletra dose should be titrated upward only after rifampicin has been initiated. <br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of rifampicin and Kaletra is contraindicated as it may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Kaletra or to the class of protease inhibitors or to other coadministered antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 10 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 20 days) to 22 HIV- subjects results in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 55%, 75% and 99% respectively. Data from 10 subjects receiving rifampicin and lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg twice daily for 7 days) showed a 2% increase in lopinavir Cmax, but decreases of 16% and 57% for AUC and Cmin, when compared to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily alone. Coadministration of rifampicin with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg twice daily for 7 days) to 9 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases of 7% and 2% for lopinavir Cmax and AUC and an increase of 3% for Cmin, when compared to 400/100 mg alone. Pharmacokinetic and safety results from the 800/200 and 400/400 studies do not allow for a dose recommendation. Nine subjects (28%) experienced a grade 2 or greater increase in ALT/AST, of which seven (21%) prematurely discontinued study per protocol. Based on the study design, it is not possible to determine whether the frequency or magnitude of the ALT/AST elevations observed is higher than what would be seen with rifampin alone. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<div>The steady-state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir were evaluated in HIV-infected adults stable on LPV/r tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) who were given rifampicin (600 mg daily), and the dose of the LPV/r gradually increased over a period of two weeks ( first to 600/150 twice daily and then to 800/200 mg twice daily). Twenty one subjects started the study, but two were withdrawn due to grade 3/4 transaminitis. The median [IQR) pre-dose LPV concentrations were 8.1 (6.2 to 9.8) mg/L at baseline, 1.7 (0.3 to 3.0) mg/L after 7 days of rifampicin, 5.9 (2.1 to 9.9) mg/L with 1.5 times the dose of LPV/r, and 10.8 (7.0 to 13.1) mg/L with double-dose LPV/r. There were no significant differences in the LPV AUC, Cmax, pre-dose concentrations, 12 h concentration, or half-life between the baseline and double-dose LPV/r time points. Doubling the dose of the tablet formulation of LPV/r overcame induction by rifampicin, with less hepatotoxicity occurring in this cohort of HIV-infected participants than reported in healthy-volunteer studies.&nbsp; The cohort consisted of HIV-infected patients who were virologically suppress with high CD4 counts &#8211; the risk of hepatotoxicity may be different in HIV-infected individuals with TB and/or with different CD4 counts.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir in HIV-infected adults receiving rifampin with adjusted doses of lopinavir-ritonavir tablets.

<div>A study looking at the interaction between rifampicin (600 mg once daily) and LPV/RTV (600/150 or 800/200 mg twice daily) in 11 HIV- subjects had to be terminated early due to severe nausea, vomiting and elevated AST/ALT. No major complaints or laboratory abnormalities were noted during the first phase of the study (rifampicin alone), but 10/11 subjects suffered from nausea and/or vomiting following the addition of LPV/RTV. No LPV was detected in trough samples from 5/11 subjects (due to either no drug intake or vomiting); trough concentrations in 3 subjects receiving 600/150 mg were 6.7, 7.2 and 10.3 &#181;g/ml and in 3 subjects receiving 800/200 mg were 8.3, 11.5 and 13.8 &#181;g/ml. The reasons for the adverse events may be related to a) the sequence of drug administration, b) non-linear pharmacokinetics of LPV/RTV after intake of higher doses, or c) unknown factors which make healthy volunteers more susceptible to adverse events. <br /><em>Unexpected high incidence of nausea, vomiting and asymptomatic elevations of AST/ALT enzymes in healthy volunteers receiving rifampin and adjusted doses of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets.

<p>Two twice-daily adjusted-dose regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir were tested in combination with rifampicin in healthy subjects. All subjects were treated with LPV/r 400/100 mg from days 1-15. From days 16-24 half the subjects were given LPV/r 800/200 mg (Arm 1) in dose titration and half LPV/r 400/400 mg (Arm 2) in dose titration. Rifampicin was given to all subjects between days 11-24. PK data was available from 19 subjects. The geometric mean ratio for lopinavir AUC12, Cmin and Cmax were 0.84, 0.43 and 1.02 respectively in arm 1 (800/200 mg) were 0.98, 1.03 and 0.93 respectively in arm 2 (400/400 mg). There was toxicity observed with the higher dose of LPV/r and rifampicin with discontinuation in 9/29 subjects (31%). The treatment of HIV-infected patients with TB with these agents must be approached with caution and close monitoring of liver function is essential. Judicious use of TDM will aid ensuring LPV levels are above the minimum required. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of adjusted-dose lopinavir-ritonavir combined with rifampin in healthy volunteers. la Porte CJ, Colbers EP, Bertz R, et al.

The LDL lowering effect of rosuvastatin appeared to be attenuated when given with lopinavir/ritonavir. Possible dose separation may be required to mitigate the interaction or a dose modification of rosuvastatin may be required. This is due to competition for uptake with the liver such that PLASMA concentrations of rosuvastatin may be increased but LIVER concentrations decreased, resulting in a decreased lipid lowering effect. Start with the lowest possible dose and titrate carefully, monitoring for side effects due to increased plasma concentrations and potential impaired lipid response.

The mechanism of this interaction may result from inhibition of transport proteins. Coadministration increased rosuvastatin AUC by 2-fold and increased Cmax by 5-fold.

<div>A case report describes an HIV-1 infected patient with moderate renal failure (CrCl 38 ml/min) receiving tenofovir (once every other day) with abacavir and lopinavir/ritonavir (both twice daily).&nbsp; The patient was switched from pravastatin to rosuvastatin because of vascular pathology.&nbsp; Other drugs included tamsulosin, gemfibrozil, amitriptyline and ciprofloxacin.&nbsp; Based on laboratory evaluation the patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and ART, ciprofloxacin and rosuvastatin were discontinued.&nbsp; Eventually ART was restarted 16 days after hospital admission and consisted of atazanavir/ritonavir, abacavir and raltegravir. Pravastatin replaced rosuvastatin.&nbsp; The authors discuss possible factors that may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis, i.e. i) rosuvastatin is a substrate of OATP1B1 which can be inhibited by lopinavir/ritonavir and gemfibrozil and ii) a possible increase in tenofovir exposure due to lopinavir/ritonavir which may have contributed to the a decline in renal function and an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis.&nbsp; Replacing lopinavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin was important for management and&nbsp;there was an important role for raltegravir.<br /><em>Rhabdomyolysis in an HIV-infected patient with impaired renal function concomitantly treated with rosuvastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir. de Kanter CTMM, Keuter M, van der Lee MJ, et al.

<div>This study explored the lipid-lowering effect of rosuvastatin and assessed the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and vice versa. HIV+ patients (n=20) on lopinavir/ritonavir with total cholesterol &gt;6.2 mmol/L were treated with rosuvastatin for 12 weeks, starting with 10 mg once daily. If fasting target values of total, HDL or LDL cholesterol or triglycerides were not reached, rosuvastatin was escalated to 20 mg or 40 mg at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Plasma lopinavir and ritonavir trough concentrations (Cmin) were determined at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12, and rosuvastatin Cmin at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Rosuvastatin was found not to influence lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations. Median (IQR) rosuvastatin Cmin for 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg were 0.97 (0.70-1.5), 2.5 (1.3-3.3) and 5.5 (3.3-8.8) ng/ml, respectively and were 1.6-fold higher than in historical healthy subjects. The authors conclude that until safety and efficacy have been confirmed in larger studies, the combination of rosuvastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir should be used with caution. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of combined use of lopinavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin in HIV-infected patients. van der Lee M, Sankatsing R, Schippers E, et al.

<p>Coadministration of lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and rosuvastatin (20 mg once daily) was studied in 15 HIV- subjects. Lopinavir and ritonavir AUC and Cmax were unaffected by rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin AUC and Cmin were unexpectedly increased by 2.1- and 4.7-fold in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir/r. The LDL lowering effects of rosuvastatin were attenuated with lopinavir/ritonavir (40% vs 27% decrease, alone vs +lopinavir/ritonavir) despite the increase in exposure. The mechanism of the interaction is not known and the authors suggest the possible dose separation to mitigate the interaction. <br /><em>Drug-drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin.

<div>&nbsp;</div>Coadministration is contraindicated in combination with Invirase/ritonavir due to the potential for life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily in combination with 2 or 3 NRTIs) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Ritonavir exposure was decreased but its effectiveness as a boosting agent was not modified. Concentrations of lopinavir were unchanged, based on historical comparison with unboosted [sic] lopinavir. <br /><em>Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012.</em></div>
<p>Evidence from several clinical trials indicates that saquinavir concentrations achieved with saquinavir 1000 mg plus lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily are similar to those achieved following saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily. Saquinavir had no effect on lopinavir concentrations, but ritonavir concentrations were decreased. The recommended dose for this combination is saquinavir 1000 mg plus lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with saquinavir should be used with caution.

<p>Pharmacokinetic data were collected from HIV+ patients receiving boosted saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily) with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily, n=32) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=45). There was no significant difference in median saquinavir exposure between the groups (Cmin 543 vs 427 ng/ml, Cmax 2300 vs 2410 ng/ml, AUC 16977 vs 15130 ng/ml.h, lopinavir vs alone). Ritonavir exposure was lower in the lopinavir group (Cmin 78 vs 194 ng/ml, Cmax 428 vs 683 ng/ml, AUC 2972vs 6506 ng/ml.h, lopinavir vs alone). Lopinavir median values obtained for Cmin, Cmax and AUC were 3310 ng/ml, 7130 ng/ml and 64940 ng/ml.h respectively and were similar to historical data. <br /><em>Saquinavir drug exposure is not impaired by the boosted protease inhibitor combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>Saquinavir and lopinavir concentrations were determined in 7 HIV+ patients receiving saquinavir (sgc)/lopinavir/ritonavir (1000/400/100 mg twice daily) and compared to historical data for saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Median saquinavir AUC (9.8 mg/L.h, IQR 8.3-24.5) and Cmax (1.6 mg/L, IQR 1.4-3.9) were lower than previously reported, though Cmin (0.4 mg/L, IQR 0.22-0.93) was similar.

AUC and Cmin obtained with saquinavir 400 mg were 55% lower than those observed with saquinavir 800 mg. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics were similar with all three saquinavir doses and were comparable to historical data; lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin with saquinavir 600 mg were 10.6&#177;3.9 &#181;g/ml. 99&#177;39 &#181;g/ml.h and 5.6&#177;2.7 &#181;g/ml respectively. <br /><em>Assessment of steady state pharmacokinetics of three dosing regimens of saquinavir administered as hard gelatin capsules in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir to HIV-infected adults.

Coadministration increased sildenafil AUC by 11-fold due to CYP3A inhibition by Kaletra. Particular caution must be used when prescribing sildenafil in patients receiving Kaletra with increased monitoring for adverse events.

<p>Particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil) in patients receiving Kaletra. Coadministration of Kaletra with these drugs is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in an increase in associated adverse reactions including hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection.

<p>Steady state pharmacokinetics of sildenafil were determined in a 44 year old male HIV+ patient stable on lopinavir/ritonavir (666/166 mg/day) and indinavir (1200 mg/day) following initiation of sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil was initiated at 25 mg once daily (for 7 days) and doses increased to obtain therapeutic concentrations, first to 25 mg twice daily (for 14 days) and then to 25 mg three times daily. AUC 0-8 h for the once daily, twice daily and three time daily regimens were 590, 518 and 800 ng/ml.h, respectively; corresponding Cmax values were 154, 159 and 183 ng/ml. Sildenafil mean half life in these subjects was 1.9 h compared to 2.6-3.1 h in the HIV+ subject. In order to achieve therapeutic concentrations, this patient had to be treated with a higher dose than the current recommendations of 25mg every 24 h or 48 h. The authors suggest that long term use of ritonavir may have resulted in delayed induction of PXR (and subsequently CYP3A4) in this patient. This would account for the sildenafil dose increase required in contrast to a dose reduction that may be required when CYP3A4 is inhibited by ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sildenafil in a patient treated with human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors.

Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Lopinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.

<div>In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD.

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Cardiotoxicity including QTc interval prolongation and torsades de pointes have been observed during sodium stibogluconate treatment. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir should be used with caution in such patients. Particular caution must be used when prescribing Lopinavir/ritonavir and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation.</span>

<p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August2007</em></p>
<p>Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed in some patients taking sodium stibogluconate and appears to be dose-related. There have also been reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving higher dose antimonial therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, ECG monitoring is recommended before and during therapy with sodium stibogluconate. Where ECG monitoring is not available, the risks and benefits of sodium stibogluconate therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. Sodium stibogluconate should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias or other risk factors known to predispose towards QT prolongation: for example, those with congenital QTc prolongation or taking concomitant drugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval <br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August2007</em></p>
<p>Various case studies and trials of efficacy/tolerability of sodium stibogluconate describe Cardiotoxicity including QTc interval prolongation and occasionally torsades de pointes during, and occasionally after discontinuation of treatment. Several authors recommend monitoring of ECG parameters where possible during treatment.<br /><em>Chulay JD et al. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1985 Jul;34(4):702-9. Franke ED et al.

<div>Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients. Particular caution must be used when prescribing Kaletra and medicinal products known to induce QT interval prolongation such as: chlorpheniramine, quinidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin. Indeed, Kaletra could increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products and this may result in an increase of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. Cardiac events have been reported with Kaletra in preclinical studies; therefore, the potential cardiac effects of Kaletra cannot be currently ruled out<br /><em>Kaletra&#174; (lopinavir/ritonavir) 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Limited, updated September 2012</em></div></span>

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.<br /><em>Norvir&#174; (Ritonavir) 100mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) administration on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity was quantified using a phenotyping biomarker cocktail. Changes in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2), and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities were evaluated using warfarin (WARF) + vitamin K, omeprazole (OMP), intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) midazolam (MDZ), and caffeine (CAF). Healthy subjects (n = 14) simultaneously received PO WARF 10 mg, vitamin K 10 mg, OMP 40 mg, CAF 2 mg/kg, and IV MDZ 0.025 mg/kg on days (D) 1 and 14, and PO MDZ 5 mg on D2 and D15. LPV/r (400/100 mg twice daily) was administered on D4-17. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activities were quantified by S-WARF AUC0-inf and OMP/5-hydroxy OMP ratio, respectively.&nbsp; After LPV/r therapy, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 activity increased by 29%, 100%, and 43% respectively.&nbsp; LPV/r therapy results in modest induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 and potent induction of CYP2C19 activity.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

<p>The interaction between tacrolimus and antiretroviral therapy (ART) was studied in 7 HIV/HCV coinfected patients who had received liver transplants. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were determined at steady state during the post operative period before and after the reintroduction of ART once tacrolimus concentrations and liver function had stabilised. Lopinavir/ritonavir markedly inhibited tacrolimus concentrations. Following the reintroduction of lopinavir/ritonavir, the tacrolimus dose fell by 99% to 0.02-0.25 mg/day (administered as 0.5-1.5 mg once every 7-25 days). Tacrolimus oral clearance decreased from 492 to 5 ml/min.

<p>Tacrolimus concentrations were monitored following kidney transplantation in two HIV+ patients receiving LPV/RTV + EFV (Patient X) or LPV/RTV (Patient Y). Tacrolimus target concentrations were defined as 15 20 ng/ml immediately post transplant and then 8-12 ng/ml. Tacrolimus was initiated at doses of 0.5 mg for Patient X and 1 mg for Patient Y. Target concentrations were reached within 2 days for Patient X and 12 h for Patient Y. Patient X had to stop tacrolimus due to high concentrations (62 ng/ml). Tacrolimus half lives were calculated as 5.5 days for Patient X and 8 days for patient Y. After reintroduction of reduced doses of tacrolimus, target concentrations were maintained with doses of 0.5 mg given every 2 days for Patient X and given every 8 days for Patient Y. When given with boosted PIs, the initial dose of tacrolimus is critical, but unpredictable with reduced doses and daily TDM required. <br /><em>Effect of coadministered boosted protease inhibitors regimen on tacrolimus blood concentration in 3 kidney transplant HIV-infected patients.

<p>Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were reported in 8 HIV+ patients who received liver transplants for end-stage chronic hepatitis C. Tacrolimus concentrations were determined ~10 days post transplantation (just prior to reintroduction of HAART) and 10 days after the reintroduction of standards doses of HAART (NFV n=2; LPV/RTV n=3; EFV n=2; NRTI n=1). During the post transplantation period, prior to the reintroduction of HAART, tacrolimus oral clearance (CL/F) ranged from 5.3 to 19.4 L/h. A large decrease in tacrolimus CL/F was observed following the reintroduction of LPV/RTV (0.5-0.9 L/h) or with NFV (1.1 and 3.0 L/h). Reintroduction of NRTIs or EFV resulted in little change in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. Coadministration of tacrolimus with LPV/RTV required dose reduction of tacrolimus to once every 5-10 days to maintain tacrolimus within the target range. <br /><em>Potent drug interactions between tacrolimus and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy in HIV-infected liver transplant recipients.

<p>The management of drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and tacrolimus in 10 HIV patients was reported. Antiretroviral agents were stopped on the day of liver transplantation and reintroduced 10 days later. All patients received tacrolimus and prednisolone as immunosuppressive agents and fluconazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ganciclovir as primary prophylaxis. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters were measured 10 days following liver transplantation and 10 days following antiretroviral re-initiation. Tacrolimus target blood concentrations were 8-20 ng/ml from baseline to week 6 and 5-15 ng/ml after week 6; tacrolimus doses were individually adjusted according to the Ctrough measured. Among the patients studied, two were on nelfinavir, three on lopinavir/ritonavir, two on efavirenz and one on three NRTIs. While the NRTIs and efavirenz led to a slight change in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir caused a large inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism, resulting in an increase in its half-life and a decrease in its clearance. Therefore, tacrolimus plasma concentrations should be monitored and drug dose adjustments performed. No alteration in the antiretroviral pharmacokinetic parameters was observed. <br /><em>Teicher E, Taburet AM, Vincent I, et al. 12th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Boston, February 2005, abstract 662.</em></p>
<p>Data were reported from three transplant patients where tacrolimus concentrations were profoundly increased following initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Patient 1 was stable on tacrolimus 5 mg twice daily (Ctrough = 10.6 ng/ml). Lopinavir/ritonavir was started and tacrolimus reduced to 6 mg/day; 2 days later Ctrough had increased to 78.5 ng/ml and tacrolimus was stopped. It was restarted after 21 days and the dose adjusted over two weeks to 0.5 mg/week which gave a Ctrough of 12.0 ng/ml. Patient 2 was stable on tacrolimus 4 mg twice daily (Ctrough 8.2-20.9 ng/ml). Lopinavir/ritonavir was started with a single tacrolimus dose of 2 mg followed by a further 1 mg dose 2 days later. Tacrolimus concentrations were 49 ng/ml (24 h), 20.6 ng/ml (60 h) and 7.2 ng/ml (38 days). Lopinavir/ritonavir was discontinued due to suspected toxicity with recurrent hepatitis C and the patient switched to nelfinavir. Patient 3 was initially stable on tacrolimus 2 mg twice daily (Ctrough 9.5-11.9 ng/ml), but discontinued tacrolimus from weeks 6 to 11 post transplant. Lopinavir/ritonavir was commenced 1 week prior to restarting tacrolimus; tacrolimus doses were adjusted until the patient stablised on 1 mg/week (Ctrough 2.9-5.4 ng/ml). <br /><em>Effect of coadministered lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) on tacrolimus blood concentration in liver transplant patients.

<p>A case was reported where addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to a patient stable on tacrolimus (5 mg twice daily) resulted in toxic concentrations of tacrolimus three days after initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

<p>The plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and abacavir, lamivudine or lopinavir was investigated in HIV+ subjects receiving TDF + 3TC/LPV (n=7), TDF + 3TC/NVP (n=8), TDF + ABC/LPV (n=7) or TDF + ABC/NVP (n=5).

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was determined in 27 HIV-negative subjects. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir increase tenofovir AUC (32%), Cmax (15%) and Cmin (51%). Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were unaffected by tenofovir (n=24). Clinical estimates of renal function were unaffected by administration of tenofovir alone or with lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) on the renal clearance of tenofovir was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving tenofovir (300 mg once daily) alone or in combination with LPV/r. Tenofovir clearance was 16% lower in subjects receiving LPV/r, consistent with a renal interaction between tenofovir and LPV/r. There was no difference in tenofovir-diphosphate concentrations when tenofovir was given alone or in combination. <br /><em>Effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the renal clearance of tenofovir in HIV-infected patients.

<p>Significant increases in TDF plasma exposure have been reported when coadministered with Kaletra. This study looked at the interaction at the intracellular level by investigating the effect of LPV/RTV (400/100 once daily) on TDF-DP concentrations in HIV+ patients taking TDF (300 mg once daily). There was a trend to higher TDF-DP concentrations when used in combination with LPV/r. However, due to interpatient variability, this did not reach statistical significance. Mean &#177; SD TDF-DP concentrations were 181.4 &#177; 80.1 and 280.3 &#177; 181.8 fmol/106 cells, alone and in combination with LPV/RTV respectively. Since target concentrations have yet to be defined for TDF-DP, the possible consequences of this increase remain unknown. <br /><em>Possible interaction between tenofovir and boosted lopinavir; analysis at the intracellular level in HIV infected patients.

<p>The effect of tenofovir on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir was investigated in 18 treatment experienced HIV+ patients. Lopinavir concentrations decreased in the presence of tenofovir (Cmin from 4.61 to 3.06 &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 10.68 to 9.65 &#181;g/ml). Decreases in ritonavir concentrations were also observed (Cmin from 0.63 to 0.35 &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 1.02 to 0.72 &#181;g/ml).

There is therefore little potential for lopinavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition.

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased lopinavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As lopinavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

<p>A case of exacerbated mania potentially related to an interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and valproic acid was reported in a 30 year old man. The subject was stable on valproic acid (250 mg, three times daily) prior to the initiation of HIV therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Three weeks after commencing HIV therapy, he became increasingly manic and his valproic acid concentration had decreased by 48% (from 495 to 238 &#181;mol/L). The valproic acid was increased to 1500 mg daily and olanzepine was introduced; this resulted in a valproic acid concentration of 392 &#181;mol/L and clinical improvement. Inhibition of valproic acid glucuronidation by ritonavir was proposed as the mechanism of interaction.<br /><em>Possible interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and valproic acid exacerbates bipolar disorder.

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<div>In order to better define the interaction between combination antiretroviral therapy and vinblastine (a substrate of CYP3A4), clinical charts were reviewed of all HIV infected patients in a centre in Rome who received a diagnosis of Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma as coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ritonavir, may decrease vinblastine metabolism and consequently increase vinblastine-related myelosuppression. It was found that the use of protease inhibitors was independently associated with WHO grade III-IV neutropaenia.&nbsp; Moreover, an inverse correlation between dosage of ritonavir and mean nadir neutrophil count was found.&nbsp; The concomitant administration of vinblastine-containing chemotherapy regimens with protease inhibitors can lead to higher levels of neutropaenia than those of different classes of drugs such as NNRTIs or integrase inhibitors.<br /><em>Detrimental clinical interaction between ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors and vinblastine in HIV-infected patients with Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma.

<div>A case report is described of a possible interaction between the lopinavir/ritonavir component of a HAART regimen and vinblastine. A 55-year old HIV+ patient receiving HAART (lamivudine, zidovudine, abacavir, lopinavir/ritonavir and nevirapine) was prescribed vinblastine monotherapy (6mg/m^2, ~10 mg) for multicentric Castleman&#8217;s disease. HAART was discontinued for the first vinblastine course which was performed with no adverse effect. Antiretroviral therapy was resumed for the following two courses which were associated with unexpected severe digestive and haematological toxicities and moderate renal failure. Vinblastine was then administered alone at increasing doses (1, 5 and 10 mg) without toxicity. HAART was then restated and the vinblastine dose reduced to 3 mg every three weeks, with the same efficacy as 10 mg without HAART and with excellent tolerance. The authors state that this represents a single drug-drug interaction between vinblastine and lopinavir/ritonavir as the other antiretrovirals contained in the HAART regimen have no suspected inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 and P-gp. <br /><em>Life-threatening interaction between antiretroviral therapy and vinblastine in HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease.

                    <span><p>Warfarin concentrations may be affected when co-administered with Kaletra due to CYP2C9 induction. It is recommended that INR (international normalised ratio) be monitored. <br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012. <br />Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) on the metabolism of S-warfarin (10 mg single doses in combination with omeprazole and vitamin K) was studied in 7 healthy volunteers. Coadministration resulted in a decrease in warfarin AUC from 14.69&#177;6.93 to 11.36&#177;4.71 &#181;g/ml.h Increased doses of drugs metabolised primarily by CYP2C9 may possibly be necessary for optimal management when given concomitantly with lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lopinavir/ritonavir induces CYP2C9 and 2C19 activity as measured by warfarin and omeprazole biomarkers in healthy human volunteers. Yeh R, Gaver V, Park J, et al. 5th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Rome, April 2004, abstract 4.1.</em></p>
<p>A case has been described of a patient on warfarin and lopinavir/ritonavir. The patient was formerly on ZDV, 3TC and lopinavir/ritonavir, but this was stopped for surgery (mitral valve replacement). Following surgery, a daily dose of warfarin between 3.75 and 5 mg was required to maintain an optimal INR after. When the antiretrovirals were reintroduced, a progressive increase in warfarin dose to 10 mg daily was required. The authors suggest that ritonavir is inducing CYP2C9. <br /><em>Drug interactions between warfarin and efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir in clinical treatment. Bonora S, Lanzafame M, D&#8217;Avolio, et al. Clin Infect Dis, 2008, 46: 146-147.</em></p>
<p>There is a case report of an HIV+ patient on warfarin whose INR decreased substantially following the initiation of lopinavir/ritonavir. Prior to commencing lopinavir/ritonavir his INR was stable between 2 and 3 whilst on other drugs including fluconazole, but in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir it dropped to between 1.0 and 1.3.Dose titration to 11 mg/day did not achieve a therapeutic INR; however when the fluconazole was discontinued, the INR increased to 2.6. The patient eventually attained a stable INR between 2 and 3 with a warfarin dose of about 13 mg/day. <br /><em>Interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and warfarin.
