Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated in the body, mostly in the liver by the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Much of a dose of adrenaline is excreted as metabolites in urine. The plasma half-life is about 2-3 minutes.

Albendazole sulphoxide is the primary metabolite, which is thought to be the active moiety in effectiveness against systemic tissue infections. Albendazole sulphoxide and its metabolites appear to be principally eliminated in bile, with only a small proportion appearing in the urine.<br /><em>Zentel&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated January 2009<br />Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em>

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination.

When raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide (20 ml single dose) were administered simultaneously, raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 44%, 49% and 63% (n=25). Coadministration of the antacid 2 h before raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 51%, 51% and 56% (n=23). Coadministration of the antacid 2 h after raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 22%, 30% and 57% (n=23). Coadministration of the antacid 4 h before raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 22%, 19% and 60% (n=17). Coadministration of the antacid 4 h after raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 30%, 32% and 62% (n=16). Coadministration of the antacid 6 h before raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 10%, 13% and 50% (n=16). Coadministration of the antacid 6 h after raltegravir decrease raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 10%, 11% and 49% (n=16). Therefore, coadministration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. <br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, February 2015.</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The effects of pH, metal salts, and omeprazole on the cellular permeativity of raltegravir were determined using Caco-2 monolayers. Cellular accumulation studies were used to determine the effect of interplay between pH and ABCB1 transport on raltegravir accumulation. Raltegravir cellular permeativity was heavily influenced by changes in extracellular pH, where apical-to-basolateral permeativity was reduced 9-fold (P &lt; 0.05) when apical pH was increased from 5 to 8.5. Raltegravir cellular permeativity was also reduced in the presence of magnesium and calcium. Omeprazole did not alter raltegravir cellular permeativity. Gastrointestinal pH and polyvalent metals can potentially alter the pharmacokinetic properties of raltegravir, and these data provide an explanation for the variability in raltegravir exposure in patients. The evaluation of how divalent-metal-containing products, such as multivitamins, that do not affect gastric pH alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics in patients is now justified.</div><p><em>Moss DM, Siccardi M, Murphy M et al.

Coadministration or staggered administration of aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids and raltegravir is not recommended. When raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and an antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide (20 ml single dose) were administered simultaneously, raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 44%, 49% and 63% (n=25). Coadministration of the antacid 2 h before raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 51%, 51% and 56% (n=23). Coadministration of the antacid 2 h after raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 22%, 30% and 57% (n=23). Coadministration of the antacid 4 h before raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 22%, 19% and 60% (n=17). Coadministration of the antacid 4 h after raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 30%, 32% and 62% (n=16). Coadministration of the antacid 6 h before raltegravir decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 10%, 13% and 50% (n=16). Coadministration of the antacid 6 h after raltegravir decrease raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 10%, 11% and 49% (n=16). Therefore, coadministration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium-containing antacids is not recommended. In drug interaction studies, calcium carbonate antacids did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Simultaneous coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) with a calcium carbonate antacid (3000 mg single dose) decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 52%, 55% and 32% (n=24).

<div>The pharmacokinetics of single-dose raltegravir (400 mg) were studied in healthy volunteers with and without an antacid (Maalox Plus containing both magnesium and aluminium hydroxide).&nbsp; Although raltegravir AUC and Cmax were unchanged with simultaneous antacid administration, the time to peak occurred 2 hours sooner and there was a 67% reduction in C12h. The authors speculate that antacid may have two effects on raltegravir pharmacokinetics.&nbsp; First to cause a faster and more uniform dissolution (earlier Tmax and less variability) and secondly binding of raltegravir to the antacid which offsets the potential for an increase in extend of absorption.&nbsp; However, it is not known if the reduction in raltegravir C12h would compromise the efficiency of the drug.</div>

No dose adjustment is required for raltegravir.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014</em>.<br />&nbsp;<br />Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir AUC by 41%, Cmax by 24% and Cmin by 77%. The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and/or tenofovir was generally similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore no dose adjustment is required. <br /><em>Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, November 2014.</em></div>
<p>Atazanavir, a strong inhibitor of UGT1A1, and atazanavir/ritonavir increase plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and raltegravir (100 mg single dose) increased raltegravir Cmax by 53%, AUC by 72% and Cmin by 95% (n=10). Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir Cmax by 24%, AUC by 41% and Cmin by 77% (n=10). However, since concomitant use of raltegravir and atazanavir/ritonavir did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies, no dosage adjustment is recommended. <br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, </em><em>February 2015</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and raltegravir were investigated in 19 HIV- subjects receiving twice daily unboosted atazanavir (300 mg twice daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily). Coadministration decreased atazanavir AUC (17%), Cmax (11%) and Cmin (29%). Atazanavir Cmin was 817 ng/ml (GM, range 250-1550 ng/ml) which is well the above the 10-fold protein binding adjusted EC90 for atazanavir against wild type HIV, and was moderately lower than historical values obtained with atazanavir/ritonavir. When given with atazanavir, the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of raltegravir increased by 54%, 39% and 48%, respectively.&nbsp;The incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia was similar after atazanavir (300 mg twice daily) alone or in the presence of raltegravir.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of twice-daily atazanavir 300 mg and raltegravir 400 mg in healthy individuals.

Raltegravir pharmacokinetics were compared to historical data from 24 HIV+ subjects receiving 10 day raltegravir monotherapy.&nbsp; Atazanavir mean AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 19237 ng.h/ml,&nbsp;2879 ng/ml and&nbsp;799 ng/ml respectively. Raltegravir mean AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were&nbsp;7649 ng.h/ml,&nbsp;1732 ng/ml and 506 ng/ml.&nbsp; Raltegravir trough concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the presence of atazanavir (506 &#177; 411 vs 177 &#177; 262 ng/ml).&nbsp; Patients with atazanavir AUC above the mean or with atazanavir concentrations exceeding the half maximal inhibitory concentration for UGT1A1 had higher raltegravir AUCs compared to patients with lower atazanavir exposure.<br /><em>Exposure-related effects of atazanavir on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in HIV-1-infected patients.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between raltegravir (a substrate of UGT1A1) and atazanavir (an inhibitor of UGT1A1) was investigated in HIV- subjects. Coadministration of raltegravir (100 mg single dose) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 7 days) increased raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 72%, 53% and 95%, respectively. When the recommend dose of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) was given with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 41%, 24% and 77%, respectively. The authors conclude that the increase in plasma concentrations of raltegravir are not clinically important and does not require dosage adjustment. <br /><em>Atazanavir modestly increases plasma levels of raltegravir in healthy subjects. Iwamoto M, Wenning LA, Mistry GC, et al. Clin Infect Dis, 2008, 47: 137-140.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of raltegravir were determined in 19 HIV- subjects following administration of raltegravir alone (400 mg twice daily) or raltegravir/atazanavir (400/400 mg once daily). High inter-individual variability was observed along with significant intra-individual diurnal variation when given twice daily. Despite a significant reduction in raltegravir-glucuronide concentrations, atazanavir did not significantly increase raltegravir concentrations. When given twice daily, geometric mean raltegravir trough concentration, Cmax and AUC were 40 ng/ml, 1016 ng/ml and 3934 ng/ml.h), respectively. When given once daily with atazanavir, raltegravir trough concentration, Cmax and AUC were 1402 ng/ml (37% increase), 13 ng/ml (67% decrease) and 5541 ng/ml.h, respectively. Although atazanavir inhibited the UDP-glucuronyl-transferase-1A1 mediated metabolism of raltegravir, trough concentrations of raltegravir were significantly lower when given once daily with atazanavir than when given twice daily alone. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of once daily raltegravir and atazanavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of raltegravir were determined in 15 HIV+ subjects stable on atazanavir (400 mg once daily) following the addition of raltegravir (800 mg once daily). Values for Ctrough, Cmax and AUC24 were compared to historical values for C12h, Cmax and AUCinf obtained from 20 HIV- subjects receiving a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg). When compared to historical data, coadministration increased raltegravir Cmax by 2.81-fold, increased AUC by 18% and decreased Ctrough by 85% (note, the data were not dose normalised and the comparison for this value is 400 mg C12h vs 800 mg C24h). Raltegravir Ctrough was below target (33 nM) in 4/15 HIV+ subjects. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of once daily raltegravir (800 mg) plus atazanavir (400 mg) in HIV-infected patients.

<p>Steady state pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and unboosted twice daily atazanavir were determined in 21 HIV+ subjects receiving atazanavir (200 mg twice daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily). High interindividual variability was observed for both atazanavir and raltegravir. Geometric mean values (95% CI) for atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 6257 ng/ml.h (4334-8172), 1062 ng/ml (676-1448) and 227 ng/ml (122-332), respectively. Values for raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Ctrough were 9085 ng/ml.h (6317-11853), 2402 ng/ml (1496-3308) and 132 ng/ml (1-263), resepectively. Five subjects (24%) had atazanavir trough concentrations below the minimum effective concentration of 150 ng/ml. 62% of subjects had viral loads &lt;50 copies/ml at entry, with all subjects reaching undetectable after 2 weeks of therapy. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of atazanavir (200 mg bid) when combined with raltegravir (400 mg bid) in HIV-1 infected adults.

For drug interaction reasons, the patient was switched from a PI-based regimen to raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine and calcium carbonate (1 g-vitamin D3 400 IU 3 times/day) was added for prevention of osteoporosis. After 10 months of an undetectable viral load and clinical evidence of a high level of adherence on this regimen, the patient developed detectable HIV-1 RNA levels with documented resistance to raltegravir His antiretroviral therapy was changed back to a protease inhibitor-based regimen, and his HIV-1 RNA level rapidly resuppressed. Therapeutic drug monitoring at the time of virologic failure showed lower than expected raltegravir concentrations at 5 hour post dose, but tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations were within the expected range.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

About 22% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.<br /><em>Piriton&#174; (Chlorphenamine) Tablets&nbsp; UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, updated May 2010</em></p>
<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids.

                    <span><p>Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the 14C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.<br /><em>Clomid&#174; (clomiphene citrate tablets USP) US Prescribing Information, Sanofi-aventis U.S. revised June 2006</em></p>
<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

<div>An in vitro study shows that the inducible enzyme CYP3A4 is a major source of oxidative metabolism of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] in human liver and small intestine and could contribute to this adverse effect. Heterologously-expressed CYP3A4 catalyzed the 23- and 24-hydroxylation of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). No human microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme tested, other than CYP3A5, supported these reactions. CYP3A4 exhibited opposite product stereochemical preference compared with that of CYP24A1, a known 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) hydroxylase. Although the metabolic clearance of CYP3A4 was less than that of CYP24A1, comparison of metabolite profiles and experiments using CYP3A-specific inhibitors indicated that CYP3A4 was the dominant source of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 23- and 24-hydroxylase activity in both human small intestine and liver. These and other data suggest that induction of CYP3A4-dependent 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) metabolism by antiepileptic drugs and other PXR ligands may diminish intestinal effects of the hormone and contribute to osteomalacia<em>Xu Y, Hashizume T, Shuhart MC et al.

<p>Vitamin D is well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract in the presence of bile. It is hydroxylated in the liver to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and then undergoes further hydroxylation in the kidney to form the active metabolite 1, 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol). The metabolites circulate in the blood bound to a specific α - globin, Vitamin D and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the bile and faeces.<br><em>Adcal D3 chewable tablets® UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ProStrakan, updated September 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><div>Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing raltegravir + darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.<br /><em>Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, November 2014.</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Raltegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT2B7) or P-glycoprotein (e.g., protease inhibitors). In drug interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing raltegravir + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving raltegravir without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.<br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, February 2015.</em></div>
<p>Darunavir trough concentrations were determined in 117 samples from 55 HIV+ patients receiving darunavir containing regimens with either a NRTI or raltegravir. Mean (&#177; sd) darunavir concentrations were higher in the NRTI subjects than in the raltegravir subjects (4.20 &#177; 2.35 vs 2.63 &#177; 84 mg/L). However, the proportion of subjects with undetectable viral loads (&lt;50 copies/ml) was higher in the raltegravir group than in the NRTI group. After adjusting for time from last drug intake and concomitant drugs, a multivariate linear regression model confirmed raltegravir to be independently related to lower darunavir concentrations. The mechanism of this unexpected interaction remains to be determined, but it does not appear to be virologically significant. <br /><em>Unexpected drug interaction between darunavir and raltegravir.

<p>Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 18 subjects. Contrary to clinical experience in HIV+ patients, eight subjects presented with a clinical adverse experience of rash, which progressed from mild/moderate to serious in one subject. Only six subjects completed the study. Based on these limited pharmacokinetic data, raltegravir AUC decreased by 29%, Cmax decreased by 33% and Cmin increased by 38% (the latter parameter showing very marked variability).

Daunorubicin is rapidly taken up by tissues, especially by the kidneys, spleen, liver and heart. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, subsequent release of drug and its metabolites from the tissues is slow (t&#189; = 55 hours). Daunorubicin is rapidly metabolised in the liver. The major metabolite daunorubicinol is also active. Daunorubicin is excreted slowly in the urine, mainly as metabolites with 25% excreted in the first 5 days. Biliary excretion also makes a significant (40%) contribution to elimination. <br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></p>
<p>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em></p></span>

For drug interaction reasons, the patient was switched from a PI-based regimen to raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine and calcium carbonate (1 g-vitamin D3 400 IU 3 times/day) was added for prevention of osteoporosis. After 10 months of an undetectable viral load and clinical evidence of a high level of adherence on this regimen, the patient developed detectable HIV-1 RNA levels with documented resistance to raltegravir His antiretroviral therapy was changed back to a protease inhibitor-based regimen, and his HIV-1 RNA level rapidly resuppressed. Therapeutic drug monitoring at the time of virologic failure showed lower than expected raltegravir concentrations at 5 hour post dose, but tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations were within the expected range. The authors suggest that calcium binding to the divalent metal ion-chelating motif of raltegravir may have led to subtherapeutic raltegravir levels in this patient.<br /><em>Virologic failure with a raltegravir-containing antiretroviral regimen and concomitant calcium administration.

                    <span>Diethylcarbamazine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and also through the skin and conjunctiva. It is widely distributed in tissues and is mainly excreted in the urine unchanged and as the N-oxide metabolite. Urinary excretion and hence plasma half-life is dependent on urinary pH. About 5% of a dose is eliminated in the faeces. Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In the gut, diloxanide furoate is largely, if not wholly, hydrolysed into diloxanide and furoic acid under the combined action of bacterial and gut esterases. After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

                    <span>Orally administered dopamine is rapidly metabolised in the G.I. tract. Following IV administration, the onset of action of dopamine occurs within 5 minutes, and the drug has a duration of action of less than 10 minutes. Dopamine is metabolised in the liver, kidneys, and plasma by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals. Dopamine is excreted in urine principally as HVA and its sulphate and glucuroide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small fraction of a dose is excreted unchanged. <br /><em>Dopamine 40 mg/ml Sterile Concentrate UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hospira UK Ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

<p>Based on the results of drug interaction studies, no dosage adjustment is recommended when efavirenz is given with raltegravir. Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg single dose) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 9 subjects. Raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 36%, 36% and 21%, respectively.<br />

<p>The potential effect of efavirenz on raltegravir pharmacokinetics was examined in healthy subjects administered raltegravir alone (400 mg single dose), followed by efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 14 days with a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg) on day 12. In the presence of efavirenz, raltegravir pharmacokinetics were moderately to weakly reduced: GMR (90% CI) for C12h, AUC and Cmax were 0.79 (0.49, 1.28), 0.64 (0.52, 0.80) and 0.64 (0.41, 0.98), respectively. Though plasma concentrations of raltegravir were reduced by efavirenz, the degree of this reduction was not considered to be clinically meaningful and no dose adjustment is required.<br />

<p>Eflornithine was administered to six healthy men in single intravenous doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and oral doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 hr after oral doses. The decay of the plasma concentrations followed first-order kinetics with a mean half-life (t 1/2) for all four doses studied of 199 +/- 6 min (+/- SD). Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight. The amount of unchanged drug in 24-hr urine samples was 47 +/- 7% and 40 +/- 11% after 10 and 20 mg/kg orally, and 78% and 81 +/- 8% after 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Twenty-four-hour urinary recovery of unchanged drug was 46.9% of the 10mg/kg and 40.3% of the 20 mg/kg oral doses. &gt;86% of the oral doses were cleared from the body by renal filtration.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

<div>The addition of etravirine (200 mg twice daily) to raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) lead to significant increases in the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of both raltegravir (29%, 21% and 54%, respectively) and darunavir (14%, 6%, and 29%, respectively).

<p>Four cases in HIV+ subjects have been reported recently where lower than anticipated raltegravir concentrations were observed when given with etravirine. The first case had raltegravir trough concentrations of 189 and 313 ng/ml on two occasions whilst on darunavir/ritonavir, enfuvirtide and raltegravir. After switching enfuvirtide for etravirine, raltegravir trough concentrations decreased to 10 ng/ml and then to 5 ng/ml one month later. The second case started a combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine, etravirine and raltegravir. Tenofovir trough concentrations were in the expected range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were considered low (30 ng/ml). Increasing raltegravir from 800 mg/day to 1200 mg/day resulted in an increase in trough concentration (67 ng/ml). The third case had low raltegravir trough concentrations on two occasions (12 and 9 ng/ml) whilst receiving darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and raltegravir. The final case switched to tenofovir, etravirine and raltegravir. Etravirine trough concentrations were within the normal range, but raltegravir trough concentrations were low (29 ng/ml). In all these cases, raltegravir concentrations were below the mean trough concentration previously observed in initial clinical trials (63 ng/ml, range 29-118 ng/ml; Markovitz et al, JAIDS, 2006, 43: 509-515). In two of the cases, concentrations were below the in vitro IC95 for raltegravir of 14.6 ng/ml. <br /><em>Etravirine-raltegravir, a marked interaction in HIV-1 infected patients: about four cases.

<p>As raltegravir is primarily glucuronidated and TMC125 induces glucuronidation, an interaction study was performed in HIV- subjects (n=19) with raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and TMC125 (200 mg twice daily). Raltegravir had no significant effect on TMC125 pharmacokinetics (increases in AUC by 10%, Cmax by 4%, Cmin by 17%). Raltegravir exposure was decreased by 10% (AUC), 11% (Cmax) and 34% (Cmin), possibly via induction of glucuronidation. Coadministration was generally safe and well tolerated and no dose adjustment is necessary in HIV+ subjects. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor TMC125 and integrase inhibitor raltegravir in healthy subjects.

When given with food, amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 25%, 25%, and 33%; raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 56%, 54% and 54%. Coadministration of unboosted fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) and raltegravir decreased amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 27%, 36% and 43% in the fasting state and by 15%, 17% and 32% with food. Coadministration of once daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 mg) without food decreased amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 18%, 24% and 50%.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Raltegravir is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 whereas gemfibrozil is mainly glucuronidated by UGT2B7. In vitro data suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits UGT1A1 and UGT1A3  and therefore could potentially increase raltegravir concentrations. However, any increase in raltegravir concentrations is unlikely to be of clinical significance with respect to safety.</span>

<p>Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration.&nbsp; After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches, but does not equal, the daily dose administered.&nbsp; As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys.&nbsp; Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine of some patients weeks after drug administration was discontinued.&nbsp; Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Griseofulvin undergoes glucuronidation, although this is not the sole route of metabolism.

In vitro studies using rat liver microsomes have shown that griseofulvin can inhibit glucuronidation of some substances, however the UGT isoforms affected are not known.

<p>Eight toxic compounds of natural origin present in the human diet or used as drugs were tested as inhibitors of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity in rat liver microsomes with 1-naphthol (1-NA), phenolphthalein (PPh) and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) as substrates. Strong inhibitory effects were observed with the antifungal drug griseofulvin (GF): at a concentration of 1 mM, GF completely suppressed the glucuronidation of 1-NA and PPh, respectively. A concentration of 0.1 mM still proved to be highly inhibitory. The inhibition by GF was non-competitive with respect to PPh and was of a mixed type toward UDP-glucuronic acid, with apparent Ki values of 40 microM and 30 microM, respectively. GF did not act as a substrate for rat microsomal UGT.<br /><em>Grancharov K, Engelberg H, Naydenova Z, et al.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <span><p>Hydralazine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations have been reported to occur in the plasma after about one hour. It is metabolised by hydroxylation of the ring system and conjugation with glucuronic acid, and by N-acetylation.<br /><em>Hydralazine Tablets BP 50mg UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, updated April 2011</em></p>
<p>Hydralazine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and peak plasma levels are reached at 1 to 2 hours. Plasma levels of apparent hydralazine decline with a half-life of 3 to 7 hours. Binding to human plasma protein is 87%. Plasma levels of hydralazine vary widely among individuals. Hydralazine is subject to polymorphic acetylation; slow acetylators generally have higher plasma levels of hydralazine and require lower doses to maintain control of blood pressure. Hydralazine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism; it is excreted mainly in the form of metabolites in the urine.<br /><em>Hydralazine hydrochloride tablets USP US Prescribing Information, TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, updated March 2012</em></p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data indicate hydralazine is absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract, and has an extensive and complex metabolism depending on acetylator status: slow acetylators undergo primary oxidative metabolism, while rapid acetylators are acetylated.<br /><em>Mulrow JP, Crawford MH.

                    <span>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

After inhalation of ipratropium bromide either with HFA 134a or CFC propellant, cumulative renal excretion over 24 hours was approximately 12% and 10%, respectively.&nbsp; In an excretion balance study cumulative renal excretion (6 days) of drug-related radioactivity (including parent compound and all metabolites) accounted for 72.1% after intravenous administration, 9.3% after oral administration and 3.2% after inhalation.

<p>After inhalation, around 10 to 30% of a dose is deposited in the lungs where it exerts its therapeutic effect. Only a small amount of ipratropium reaches the systemic circulation. The majority of a dose is swallowed but is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration, the apparent systemic availability was around 2%, and after inhalation it was 6.9%.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>The bioavailabilities of a conventional and two slow release 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) formulations were compared after oral administration in a three way cross-over study in 8 male volunteers. In a further group of 6 male volunteers the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ISDN were investigated after intravenous infusion of a median dose of 14.1 mg for 2.5 h. The median elimination half-lives of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and IS-5-MN-2-Glu were 0.7, 5.1, 3.2 and 2.5 h, respectively. Apart from IS-5-MN-2-Glu, with a renal clearance of 5.9 l/min which suggested substantial glucuronidation in the kidney, the renal clearances of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and the corresponding amounts excreted were negligible. 27.8% of the administered ISDN was excreted as IS-5-MN-2-Glu (8.7%) and IS (19.1%). Calculations based on the two mononitrate metabolites formed from ISDN showed an incomplete recovery of 84.1%, leading to the assumption that a simultaneous denitration to IS must have occurred. <br /><em>Abshagen U, Betzien G, Endele R et al.

After a washout period, participants received a second single dose of lamotrigine (100 mg) without raltegravir (day 32). In group B, 12 participants received the same treatment as in group A but in reverse order. AUCs (0-48 h) were determined for lamotrigine and lamotrigine-2N-glucuronide on days 4 and 32. AUCs (0-8 h) were determined for raltegravir when coadministered with lamotrigine. There was no significant effect of raltegravir on lamotrigine AUC (1% decrease) and Cmax (6% decrease). The mean ratio of the AUCs of lamotrigine-2N-glucuronide to lamotrigine was similar when lamotrigine was taken alone (0.35) or when taken with raltegravir (0.36). Raltegravir pharmacokinetics were similar to historical controls, indicating no significant effect of a single dose of lamotrigine on raltegravir. It was observed that raltegravir AUC displayed large interindividual variability (CV=77%) and possible diurnal variation (morning trough concentrations were 3 to 4-fold higher than at 8 h post dose). <br /><em>The effect of raltegravir on the glucuronidation of lamotrigine. van Luin M, Colbers A, Verwey-van Wissen CP, et al.

<p>The interaction between raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was determined in 12 HIV- subjects. Lopinavir had no effect on raltegravir AUC or Cmax (5.3 vs 5.4 mg/L.h and 1698 vs 1687 ng/ml, alone vs combination respectively) but decreased raltegravir Cmin by 30% (49.4 vs 34.4 ng/ml). Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were similar when given alone or with raltegravir. Despite a decrease of 30%, raltegravir Cmin remained above the estimated IC95 of 15 ng/ml, suggesting that raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can be coadministered without dose adjustments of either drug. <br /><em>RAL-KAL: Pharmacokinetics of coadministered raltegravir and lopinavir-ritonavir in healthy adults.

                    <span>Mannitol is metabolized only very slightly, if at all, to glycogen in the liver. The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

<div>Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and maraviroc (300 mg twice daily) to 17 subjects decreased the Cmin, AUC and Cmax of maraviroc by 10%, 14% and 21%, respectively.

The recommended dose of maraviroc when coadministered with&nbsp;raltegravir is 300 mg twice daily.

<p>The two-way pharmacokinetic interaction between maraviroc and raltegravir was assessed in a healthy volunteer, fixed sequence study with subjects receiving raltegravir (400 mg twice daily for 3 days) then maraviroc (300 mg twice daily for 6 days) followed by both drugs for 3 days. Drug concentrations were determined on the last day of dosing of each phase. Relative to individual monotherapy, co-administration decreased maraviroc mean AUC and Cmax by 14% and 20%, respectively, and decreased raltegravir mean AUC and Cmax by 37% and 33%, respectively. The authors suggest that the pharmacokinetic changes are unlikely to be of clinical significance and hence no dose adjustment will be necessary when the drugs are co-administered. <br /><em>Assessment of the pharmacokinetics of co-administered maraviroc and raltegravir.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. Therefore no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.&nbsp;<br /><em>Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, <em><em>November 2014</em></em>.</em></p>
<p>Raltegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of proton pump inhibitors. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg daily) and raltegravir (400 mg single dose) to 14 subjects (10 for AUC) increased raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 3.12-fold, 4.15-fold and 1.46-fold, respectively. <br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, February 2015.</em></p>
<p>The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir alone and in combination with omeprazole were studied in 14 healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg) alone or 2 h after omeprazole (20 mg once daily for 4 days). Coadministration increased raltegravir AUC by 3.12-fold, Cmax by 4.15-fold and Cmin by 1.46-fold. As the increase in Cmin was relatively minor and there was no significant change in half-life, the increase in exposure is likely due to an increase in gastric pH increasing the solubility and, absorption and bioavailability of raltegravir rather than an effect on the metabolism or clearance of raltegravir. Although omeprazole increased raltegravir exposure by 3-4-fold in healthy subjects, exploratory pharmacokinetic data in HIV+ subjects demonstrated a reduced effect. Evaluation of the safety profile in HIV+ patients receiving acid reducing agents has not identified any areas of concern and therefore the authors indicate that the data support the use of raltegravir in patients receiving acid reducing agents with no dosage adjustment. Further investigation is needed to determine i) the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir with acid reducing agents in HIV+ patients and ii) the PK-PD relationship of raltegravir. <br /><em>Effects of omeprazole on plasma levels of raltegravir.

Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

<p>Oxytocin has a plasma half-life of about 1 to 6 minutes which is decreased in late pregnancy and during lactation. Following intravenous administration of oxytocin, uterine response occurs almost immediately and subsides within 1 hour. Following intramuscular injection of the drug, uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes and persists for 2 to 3 hours. Its rapid removal from plasma is accomplished largely by the kidney and the liver.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied.

                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

<p>The interaction between raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and pravastatin (40 mg once daily) was studied in 24 healthy subjects. Coadministration had no significant effect on pravastatin AUC (4% decrease) or Cmax (4% increase). The mean decrease in LDL after 4 days of pravastatin was the same alone and with raltegravir.

Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

<p>Coadministration of rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) and raltegravir (in combination with tenofovir-DF and lamivudine) was studied in two groups. Patients in arm 1 (n=21), received raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) whereas in arm 2 (n=16), patients received raltegravir at a higher dose (800 mg twice daily initially then 400 mg twice daily 4 weeks after rifampicin discontinuation). Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed over 12-hour periods, 4 weeks after initiation of raltegravir together with rifampicin (period 1), 4 weeks after rifampicin discontinuation (period 2), and after the raltegravir dose reduction in arm 2 (period 3).In arm 1, the geometric mean ratio (GMR) between period 1 and period 2 was 0.94 (90% confidence interval [CI], .64-1.37) for AUC, and 0.69 (90% CI, .42-1.13) for C12. In arm 2, the corresponding GMRs were 0.75 (90% CI, .48-1.17) and 1.10 (90% CI, .61-2.00) for period 1 vs period 2, and 1.10 (90% CI, .78-1.55) and 1.68 (90% CI, .88-3.23) for period 1 vs period 3. The double dose of raltegravir overcompensated for rifampicin induction, but the standard dose was associated with only small decreases in AUC and C12 during rifampicin coadministration, warranting further evaluation in patients with HIV/tuberculosis coinfection.&nbsp;<br><em>Pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in HIV-infected patients on rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy.

<p>Over a period of 38 days, healthy subjects received 5 days of standard-dose raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) followed by 28 days of standard-dose raltegravir plus rifampicin three times a week followed by 5 days of high-dose (800 mg twice daily) raltegravir plus rifampicin three times a week. Sixteen subjects (12 females) completed the study. Raltegravir trough plasma concentration (C12) was significantly lower in the presence of rifampicin when dosed at 400 mg twice daily (40%), which was not observed with 800 mg twice daily dosing. Raltegravir Cmax and AUC were both significantly higher in the presence of rifampicin when dosed at 800 mg twice daily (76% and 84%, respectively), but this dose was well tolerated. This study suggests that rifampicin induction of raltegravir is comparable between daily and intermittent rifampicin. In the absence of definitive clinical efficacy data to suggest otherwise, doses of 800 mg of raltegravir twice daily with rifampicin thrice weekly are well tolerated and yield higher AUCs and comparable C12 when compared with raltegravir alone.&nbsp;<br><em>Effect of intermittent rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and safety of raltegravir.

<p>In a multicentre, randomised trial at eight sites in Brazil and France, 155 antiretroviral-naive adult patients with HIV-1 and tuberculosis (aged ≥18 years with a plasma HIV RNA concentration of &gt;1000 copies per mL) were randomised to receive raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir 800 mg twice daily, or efavirenz 600 mg once daily plus tenofovir and lamivudine. Patients began study treatment after the start of tuberculosis treatment. 153 (51 in each group) received at least one dose of the study drug and were included in the primary analysis. 133 patients (87%) completed follow-up at week 48. At week 24, virological suppression was achieved in 39 patients (76%, 95% CI 65-88) in the raltegravir 400 mg group, 40 patients (78%, 67-90) in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and 32 patients (63%, 49-76) in the efavirenz group. The adverse-event profile was much the same across the three groups. Three (6%) patients allocated to efavirenz and three (6%) patients allocated to raltegravir 800 mg twice daily discontinued the study drugs due to adverse events. Seven patients died during the study (one in the raltegravir 400 mg group, four in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and two in the efavirenz group): none of the deaths was deemed related to study treatment. Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily might be an alternative to efavirenz for the treatment of patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis.&nbsp;<br><em>Raltegravir for the treatment of patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (ANRS 12 180 Reflate TB): a multicenter, phase 2, non-comparative, open-label, randomized trial.

<p>Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of rifampicin administration on raltegravir pharmacokinetics. Study 1 examined rifampicin (600 mg once daily) on the PK of single dose raltegravir (400 mg); study 2 examined rifampicin (600 mg once daily) on the PK of raltegravir (800 mg twice daily) compared to raltegravir alone (400 mg twice daily). The results demonstrated a substantial effect of rifampicin. In study 1 raltegravir exposure decreased by 61% (C12h), 40% (AUC) and 38% (Cmax). In study 2, raltegravir trough concentrations decreased by 53%, but AUC and Cmax increased by 27% and 62%. Doubling the dose of raltegravir to 800 mg when given with rifampicin compensated for the effect on AUC but not on C12h. On the basis of these data, the recommendation is that if coadministration is unavoidable, a doubling of the raltegravir dose should be considered.&nbsp;<br><em>Effect of rifampin, a potent inducer of drug metabolising enzymes, on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Wenning LA, Hanley WD, Brainard DM, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2009, 53(7): 2852-2856.</em></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>It was investigated whether increasing raltegravir to 800 mg twice daily when given with rifampicin (600 mg once daily) could overcome the inducing effect of rifampicin. When compared to raltegravir alone (400 mg twice daily), coadministration of the higher dose with rifampicin decreased raltegravir trough concentrations by 53%, but increased AUC and Cmax by 27% and 62%, respectively. Therefore, doubling the dose of raltegravir does not overcome the effect of rifampicin on raltegravir trough concentrations.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Doubling the dose of raltegravir does not increase trough levels in the presence of rifampin.

<p>The potential effect of ritonavir on raltegravir pharmacokinetics was examined in healthy subjects administered raltegravir alone (400 mg single dose), followed by ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) for 16 days with a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg) on day 14. In the presence of ritonavir, raltegravir pharmacokinetics were not significantly affected: the GMR (90% CI) for C12h, AUC and Cmax were 0.99 (0.70, 1.40), 0.84 (0.70, 1.01) and 0.76 (0.55, 1.04), respectively. <br /><em>Minimal effects of ritonavir and efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

It penetrates into the CSF within 4 hours of an oral dose to produce therapeutic concentrations, which may be more than half those in the blood. Up to 40% of sulfadiazine in the blood is present as the acetyl derivative. About 50% of a single dose of sulfadiazine given orally is excreted in the urine in 24 hours; 15 to 40% is excreted as the acetyl derivative. The urinary excretion of sulfadiazine and the acetyl derivative is dependent on pH. About 30% is excreted unchanged in both fast and slow acetylators when the urine is acidic whereas about 75% is excreted unchanged by slow acetylators when the urine is alkaline.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21).

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.</span>

                    <span><div><p>Tenofovir-DF may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, the  mechanism for this effect is unknown. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF  and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir AUC by 49%,  Cmax by 64% and Cmin by 3%. Tenofovir AUC decreased by 10%, Cmax by 33%  and Cmin by 13%. From the clinical trials, a large proportion of  patients used atazanavir and/or tenofovir-DF, both agents that result in  increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background  regimens.The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir  and/or tenofovir-DF was generally similar to the safety profile of  patients who did not use these agents. Therefore no dose adjustment is  required. <br /><em>Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, </em><em>November 2014</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and raltegravir  (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir Cmax by 64%, AUC by 49% and  Cmin by 3% (n=9). Raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful  effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. <br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, </em><em>February 2015</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily for 4 days) and  tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily for 7 days) alone and in combination for  4 days was studied in HIV- subjects. Pharmacokinetic profiles were also  determined in HIV+ patients given raltegravir monotherapy alone or in  combination with tenofovir-DF/lamivudine. In healthy volunteers  raltegravir AUC and Cmax were modestly increased in the presence of  tenofovir-DF (49% and 64%, respectively), while there was no effect of  tenofovir-DF on raltegravir Cmin (3% increase). However, there was a  modest increase of 42% in Cmin in HIV-infected patients. Raltegravir  only had a small effect on tenofovir-DF AUC (10% decrease), Cmax (23%  decrease) and Cmin (13% decrease). The authors conclude that  coadministration of raltegravir and tenofovir-DF does not change the  pharmacokinetics of either drug to a clinically meaningful degree and  consequently may be coadministered without dose adjustments. <br /><em>Lack  of a significant interaction between raltegravir and tenofovir.

                    <span>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

<p>Tipranavir/ritonavir reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) decreased raltegravir Cmax by 18% and AUC by 24% (n=15), and decreased Cmin by 55% (n=14).

<div>Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg BID) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg BID) had no effect on raltegravir Cmax or AUC, but decreased C12 by 45%.

<div>Tipranavir/ritonavir reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir. Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) to 15 subjects decreased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 18%, 24% and 55%.

<div><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.</em></div><br />An open label study was conducted in 18 healthy subjects who received raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) for 4 days (period 1), tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) for 7 days (period 2) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) for 4 days (period 3). Raltegravir C12h was decreased by 55% when raltegravir was given with tipranavir/ritonavir, but AUC and Cmax were not significantly reduced. The authors concluded that although raltegravir C12h was decreased, favourable efficacy data in phase III studies indicate that tipranavir/ritonavir may be administered with raltegravir without dose adjustments. <br /><em>Effect of tipranavir/ritonavir on pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) were determined following coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) to 7 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration had no significant effect on raltegravir Cmax (5% increase) or Ctrough (7% increase) but decreased AUC by 28%.

<p><em><strong>LHPG Comment:</strong> concentrations are as cited in abstract i.e. ng/ml, but this should be &#181;g/ml.</em> <br />A possible interaction between raltegravir and tipranavir/ritonavir was reported in three subjects stable on antiretroviral regimens containing enfuvirtide and tipranavir/ritonavir. After switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir, all three developed hepatic cytolysis. Liver function tests increased within 2-4 weeks of the switch with AST increasing to 4-10x the upper limit of normal and ALT increasing to 4-40x the upper limit of normal. In two patients, tipranavir was changed to darunavir and liver function normalised. In one patient, with lower LFT abnormalities, tipranavir was continued and liver function was 2x the upper limit of normal within 4 weeks. Tipranavir concentrations were available for this patient and were 46 ng/ml whilst on enfuvirtide, 108 ng/ml after the switch to raltegravir, and 40 ng/ml after improvement of LFTs. <br /><em>Development of hepatic cytolysis after switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir in virologically suppressed patients treated with tipranavir/ritonavir.

                    <span><p>In vivo, triclabendazole is rapidly oxidised into its sulfoxide metabolite, which is further oxidised to the sulfone metabolite. The sulfoxide form is predominant in plasma, with the parent compound and the sulfone metabolite having AUCs respectively of approximately 1% and 10% of that of the sulfoxide. The rapid biotransformation of triclabendazole in man and the previous findings in animals produced evidence of presystemic biotransformation including first-pass metabolism of triclabendazole. In animals, the drug is largely excreted via the biliary tract in the faeces (90%), together with the sulfoxide and subsequently the sulfone metabolite. Less than 10% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Egaten&#174; Summary of product Charateristics, Novartis Pharma AG Basel, Switzerland, Produced July 2000</em></p>

                    <span><p><br />Vancomycin is metabolized only to a low extent. After parenteral administration it is excreted almost completely as microbiologically active substance (approx. 75-90% within 24 hours) through glomerular filtration via the kidneys. Biliary excretion is insignificant (less than 5% of a dose). The clearance of vancomycin from plasma correlates nearly with the glomerular filtration rate. No vancomycin metabolites have been identified so far in humans<br /><em>Vancomycin, 500 mg, powder for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Limited, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p>In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/hr, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/hr. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg. There is no apparent metabolism of the drug.<br /><em>Sterile vancomycin hydrochloride, USP Fliptop Vial For Intravenous Use, US Prescribing Information, Hospira Inc, updated December 2007</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><div>In vitro studies have shown raltegravir cellular permeativity was decreased in the presence of the divalent cations magnesium and calcium, but not in the presence of the monovalent cation potassium. Raltegravir may bind to the divalent metals and form a metal-drug complex which is unable to cross the cell membrane. <br /><em>Divalent metals and pH alter raltegravir disposition in Vitro. Moss DM, Siccardi M, Murphy M, at al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2012, 56(6): 3020-6.</em><br /><br />A case report describes a 39-year-old, HIV-1-infected man who experienced virologic failure while receiving a raltegravir-containing antiretroviral regimen with concomitant calcium administration. For drug interaction reasons, the patient was switched from a PI-based regimen to raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine and calcium carbonate (1 g-vitamin D3 400 IU 3 times/day) was added for prevention of osteoporosis. After 10 months of an undetectable viral load and clinical evidence of a high level of adherence on this regimen, the patient developed detectable HIV-1 RNA levels with documented resistance to raltegravir His antiretroviral therapy was changed back to a protease inhibitor-based regimen, and his HIV-1 RNA level rapidly resuppressed. Therapeutic drug monitoring at the time of virologic failure showed lower than expected raltegravir concentrations at 5 hour post dose, but tenofovir and emtricitabine concentrations were within the expected range. The authors suggest that calcium binding to the divalent metal ion-chelating motif of raltegravir may have led to subtherapeutic raltegravir levels in this patient.<br /><em>Virologic failure with a raltegravir-containing antiretroviral regimen and concomitant calcium administration.
