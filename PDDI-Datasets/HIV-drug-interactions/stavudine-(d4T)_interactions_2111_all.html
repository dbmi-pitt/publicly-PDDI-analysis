                    <span>Adrenaline is a naturally occurring catecholamine secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to exertion or stress. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated in the body, mostly in the liver by the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Much of a dose of adrenaline is excreted as metabolites in urine. The plasma half-life is about 2-3 minutes. However, when given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, local vasoconstriction may delay absorption so that the effects may last longer than the half-life suggests.<br /><em>Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Injection BP 1 in 1000 UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hameln pharmaceuticals ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion. After oral administration, approximately 20-40% is excreted unchanged in the urine, whereas about 60-80% is excreted unchanged in the urine after parenteral administration. As stavudine is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously.

                    <span>Large doses of ascorbic acid may cause the urine to become acidic causing unexpected renal tubular reabsorption of acidic drugs, thus producing an exaggerated response. Conversely basic drugs may exhibit decreased reabsorption resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect.&nbsp; Ascorbic acid is readily oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate - 2 - sulphate. Metabolic turnover appears to be greater in females than males. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body and after an intravenous dose, about 40% is excreted in 8 hours, which is increased to about 70% after tissue saturation. The amount of unchanged drug is dose dependent; in women the excretion of ascorbic acid appears to vary with the stage of the menstrual cycle and it is decreased when taking oral contraceptives. Oxalic acid and ascorbate - 2 - sulphate are excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Ascorbic Acid Injection 500mg/5ml UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated March 2009</em></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction when atropine is used either systemically or as eye drops. Up to 50% of a dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions with stavudine via competition for renal elimination pathways.</span>

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Atropine is also absorbed by mucous membranes but less readily from the eye and skin, although significant toxicity can sometimes occur through absorption of excessive eye drops. Atropine is metabolised by hepatic oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites, with about 2% undergoing hydrolysis to tropine and tropic acid. About 30% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Only trace amounts of the dose are eliminated in the faeces.<br /><em>Minims Atropine Sulphate 1%, Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

<p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolized in the liver predominantly by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to 2,6-pipecoloxylidine (PPX), both mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4. The terminal half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours, and in neonates it is prolonged up to eight hours. The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anaesthetics and their metabolites. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug.<br /><em>Sensorcaine&#174; Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection USP Canadian Product Monograph, AstraZeneca Canada Inc, Last revised: February 2011</em></p></span>

<div>An in vitro study investigated the interaction of human-OAT2 and rat-OAT2 renal organic anion transporters with cephalosporin antibiotics using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human-OAT2 and rat-OAT2. Human-OAT2 is localized to the basolateral side of the proximal tubule, whereas rat-OAT2 is localized to the apical side of the proximal tubule. Cefotaxime dose-dependently inhibited organic anion uptake mediated by human-OAT2 and rat-OAT2.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>In a study of 2 healthy subjects, ceftazidime was administered by i.v. infusion and 1 g probenecid was administered orally after steady state plasma concentrations were reached. In a second session, ceftazidime was administered at increasing infusion rates such that three different levels of plasma drug concentration were achieved. The renal clearance of ceftazidime was calculated based upon unbound plasma concentration, and tubular clearance was estimated by subtracting inulin clearance from the renal clearance of the antibiotic. Non-linear regression analysis was used to estimate parameters describing the saturability of tubular excretion and the effect of probenecid inhibition. Tubular excretion of ceftazidime was practically zero, and there was no significant inhibition of renal clearance when administered with probenecid.<br /><em>The renal clearance of cefuroxime and ceftazidime and the effect of probenecid on their tubular excretion.

                    <span>The primary UGT enzymes responsible for chloramphenicol O-glucuronidation were evaluated in vitro. Reaction phenotyping for the glucuronidation of chloramphenicol with 12 expressed human liver UGT isoforms has identified UGT2B7 as having the highest activity for 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9. The formation of 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronide by pooled HLM and expressed UGT2B7 exhibited substrate inhibition kinetics with apparent K(m) values of 408.2 and 115.0 microM, respectively. Azidothymidine (AZT) and hyodeoxycholic acid (substrates of UGT2B7) inhibited 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation in pooled HLMs. In 10 donor HLM preparations, both chloramphenicol 3-O- and chloramphenicol 1-O-glucuronidation showed a significant correlation with AZT glucuronidation (UGT2B7) at 30 microM chloramphenicol. These results suggest that UGT2B7 is the primary human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform catalyzing 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9.<br /><em>Identification of human UGT2B7 as the major isoform involved in the O-glucuronidation of chloramphenicol.

<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

                    <span>Actinomycin D (ActD) is a transcription inhibitor and has been used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. ActD has been reported to be a potential inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication due to its ability to inhibit reverse transcription. In contrast to what was expected, low concentrations of ActD (1 to 10 nM) upregulated HIV-1 replication 8- to 10-fold in MT-2 cells and had no effect on HIV-2 replication or on HIV-1 replication in MT-4, Jurkat, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The upregulation of HIV-1 replication was associated with an increase in HIV-1 transcription and a decrease in CD4 and CXCR4 expression. To further evaluate the effects of ActD on emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 replication, a series of drug resistance assays were performed. Of interest, treatment of MT-2 cells with ActD also led to a high level of resistance to thymidine analogs (&gt;1,000-fold increase in resistance to zidovudine and &gt;250-fold to stavudine) but not to other nucleoside reverse transcriptases (RT), nonnucleoside RT, or protease inhibitors. This resistance appeared to be due to a suppression of host cell thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) expression. These results indicate that ActD leads to a novel form of thymidine analog resistance by suppressing host cell TK-1 expression. These results suggest that administration of combination drugs to HIV-1-infected patients may induce resistance to antiretroviral compounds via a modification of cellular factors.<br /><em>Actinomycin D induces high-level resistance to thymidine analogs in replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by interfering with host cell thymidine kinase expression.

                    <span><p>Daunorubicin hydrochloride is mainly metabolized in the liver; each accompanying medication influencing liver function may also influence the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin hydrochloride and as a consequence influence efficacy and/or toxicity. Daunorubicin is rapidly taken up by tissues, especially by the kidneys, spleen, liver and heart. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, subsequent release of drug and its metabolites from the tissues is slow (t&#189; = 55 hours). Daunorubicin is rapidly metabolised in the liver. The major metabolite daunorubicinol is also active. Daunorubicin is excreted slowly in the urine, mainly as metabolites with 25% excreted in the first 5 days. Biliary excretion also makes a significant (40%) contribution to elimination. <br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></p>
<div>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em>

<div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, or zidovudine). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>Coadministration is not recommended. Fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in patients receiving didanosine and ribavirin with or without stavudine. Pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving didanosine in association with hydroxyurea and stavudine. Specific interaction studies have been conducted with stavudine without evidence of interaction. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of didanosine and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided. When the buffered formulation of ddI (100 mg twice daily for 4 days) was coadministered with stavudine (40 mg twice daily for 4 days) to 10 HIV-negative subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. When the same doses were studied in 10 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in stavudine AUC and a 17% increase in Cmax. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration is not recommended. Pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine. In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, e.g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet. <em>Zerit Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2011.</em></p>
<p>Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatmentexperienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and<br />close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. Patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided.. Coadministration of stavudine (40 mg twice daily for 4 days) and didanosine (100 mg twice daily for 4 days) was studied in 10 HIV-infected subjects. There was no change in stavudine AUC and a 17% increase in Cmax. Didanosine AUC and Cmax were unaltered. <br /><em>Zerit Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of single and coadministered doses of didanosine (100 mg) and stavudine (40 mg) were evaluated in 10 HIV-positive subjects. No significant changes in Cmax, AUC, elimination half life or renal clearance of didanosine and stavudine were observed when the drugs were administered simultaneously. Cmax and AUC values for didanosine (alone vs. combination) were 422&#177;184 vs. 419&#177;153 mg/ml and 615&#177;170 vs. 637&#177;155 ng/ml.h, respectively. Cmax and AUC values obtained for stavudine were 603&#177;160 vs. 726&#177;188 and 1246&#177;230 vs. 1326&#177;267 ng/ml.h, respectively. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of co-administered didanosine and stavudine in HIV-seropositive male patients.

                    <span>Diethylcarbamazine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and also through the skin and conjunctiva. It is widely distributed in tissues and is mainly excreted in the urine unchanged and as the N-oxide metabolite. Urinary excretion and hence plasma half-life is dependent on urinary pH. About 5% of a dose is eliminated in the faeces. Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In the gut, diloxanide furoate is largely, if not wholly, hydrolysed into diloxanide and furoic acid under the combined action of bacterial and gut esterases. After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

Following IV administration, the onset of action of dopamine occurs within 5 minutes, and the drug has a duration of action of less than 10 minutes. Dopamine is metabolised in the liver, kidneys, and plasma by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals. Dopamine is excreted in urine principally as HVA and its sulphate and glucuroide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small fraction of a dose is excreted unchanged. <br /><em>Dopamine 40 mg/ml Sterile Concentrate UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hospira UK Ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

<p>The pharmacokinetics as well as erythrocyte and plasma protein binding of doxycycline were studied in fifteen patients with various renal function impairments after oral doxycycline polyphosphate single administration. Plasma half-life (t 1/2), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), urinary excretion, renal clearance, erythrocyte and plasma protein binding (%) were regressed vs creatinine clearance. No significant correlations were observed between t 1/2 or AUC and renal function nor plasma protein binding and plasma albumin concentrations. Significant correlations were obtained between urinary excretion, renal clearance, erythrocyte binding, plasma protein binding and creatinine clearance. Constancy of overall elimination parameters in renal failure is due to parallel increase in plasma free fraction of doxycycline.<br /><em>The effects of chronic renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline in man.

<div>Eflornithine was administered to six healthy men in single intravenous doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and oral doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 hr after oral doses. The decay of the plasma concentrations followed first-order kinetics with a mean half-life (t 1/2) for all four doses studied of 199 +/- 6 min (+/- SD). Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight. The amount of unchanged drug in 24-hr urine samples was 47 +/- 7% and 40 +/- 11% after 10 and 20 mg/kg orally, and 78% and 81 +/- 8% after 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Twenty-four-hour urinary recovery of unchanged drug was 46.9% of the 10mg/kg and 40.3% of the 20 mg/kg oral doses. &gt;86% of the oral doses were cleared from the body by renal filtration. In the case of intravenous dosing, 81% of the drug was eliminated by the kidneys. <br /><em>Kinetics of alpha-difluoromethylornithine: an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Ephedrine is predominantly excreted unchanged via renal pathways. There are no clear data to suggest whether elimination of ephedrine occurs via active renal transport or glomerular filtration, therefore competition for active renal elimination pathways with stavudine can not be ruled out. As levels of either drug may potentially be increased, monitoring for adverse events and renal function may be warranted. </span>

                    <span><p>Ephedrine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and extensively distributed throughout the body with accumulation in the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen and brain. The plasma half-life is reported to be between 3-11 hours, with up to 95% being excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Ephedrine Hydrochloride Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Wockhardt UK Ltd, updated November 2008</em></p>
<div>A pharmacokinetic model was developed based on the simultaneous modelling using plasma samples gathered from two clinical trials. Treatments consisted of single-doses of pharmaceutical caffeine and ephedrine, given alone or together, and an herbal formulation containing both caffeine and ephedrine. A mixed-effect statistical model and the program NONMEM was used to take account of intersubject variability. Three hundred and seventy-nine ephedrine, 352 norephedrine, 417 caffeine plasma concentrations and 40 ephedrine urine concentrations were obtained from 24 subjects. Ephedrine is mostly excreted unchanged in the urine, but is also metabolized to norephedrine to a small and variable extent, involving enzymatic N-demethylation and oxidative deaminiation of the side chain. The variance in Km was relatively large, indicating substantial variation in the extent of metabolism of ephedrine to norephedrine. This pathway, however, is minor compared with the renal elimination of ephedrine and, even after repeated drug intake, significant drug accumulation would not be expected. Although a saturable metabolism of ephedrine to norephedrine was observed, this was thought to represent a minor path of ephedrine elimination.<br /><em>Mechanistic pharmacokinetic modelling of ephedrine, norephedrine and caffeine in healthy subjects.

<p>The disposition and metabolic fate of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T) were evaluated both in isolated hepatocytes and in nonhuman primates. Rapid formation of thymine and beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) occurred following incubation of hepatocytes with 10 microM [5(-3)H]D4T. Substantial levels of tritiated water were also detected. Exposure of cells to D4T in the presence of either 1 mM thymine or 10 microM benzyloxybenzyluracil, an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, decreased intracellular BAIBA levels by approximately 89 and 63%, respectively. Concurrently, [3H]thymine levels increased two- to fivefold. These results are consistent with D4T being cleaved to thymine, which is then degraded to BAIBA. A similar metabolic disposition was observed in monkeys following administration of 25 mg of [5(-3)H]D4T per kg of body weight. Approximately 50% of the administered dose was recovered in urine within 24 h, with the majority of the radioactivity representing unchanged drug. <br /><em>Cretton EM, Zhou Z, Kidd LB, In vitro and in vivo disposition and metabolism of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <span>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span><div>When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I. Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

No further cilastatin appeared in the urine thereafter. Approximately 10% was found as the N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase comparable to that of cilastatin. Activity of dehydropeptidase-I in the kidney returned to normal levels shortly after the elimination of cilastatin from the blood stream.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Since it is hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase-I, a zinc metallo-enzyme resident in the brush border of the renal tubule, imipenem is co-administered with cilastatin, a reversible inhibitor of this enzyme. This provides clinically relevant concentrations of imipenem in the urine for 8-10 h after a 500 mg dose. Renal clearance of unchanged imipenem accounts for 60-70% of plasma clearance when the imipenem is given with cilastatin. Administration of radiolabelled drugs results in recovery of over 99% of the radiolabel in the urine for both imipenem and cilastatin. With increasing renal dysfunction, the half-life of imipenem is controlled by a metabolic clearance pathway which is unaffected by cilastatin. Renal clearance is by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion for both imipenem and cilastatin. <br /><em>An overview of the pharmacology of imipenem/cilastatin. Drusano GL.

After inhalation of ipratropium bromide either with HFA 134a or CFC propellant, cumulative renal excretion over 24 hours was approximately 12% and 10%, respectively.&nbsp; In an excretion balance study cumulative renal excretion (6 days) of drug-related radioactivity (including parent compound and all metabolites) accounted for 72.1% after intravenous administration, 9.3% after oral administration and 3.2% after inhalation. The main urinary metabolites bind poorly to the muscarinic receptor and have to be regarded as ineffective.<br /><em>Atrovent&#174; (Ipratropium bromide) 20 micrograms/actuation Inhaler CFC-Free UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated August 2011</em></p>
<p>After inhalation, around 10 to 30% of a dose is deposited in the lungs where it exerts its therapeutic effect. Only a small amount of ipratropium reaches the systemic circulation. The majority of a dose is swallowed but is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration, the apparent systemic availability was around 2%, and after inhalation it was 6.9%. Ipratropium and its metabolites are eliminated in the urine and faeces.<br /><em>Ensing K, et al.

                    <span><p>Isosorbide dinitrate is readiliy absorbed from the oral mucosa and also following oral administration. It undergoes extensive first pass metabolism, mainly in the liver. <br /><em>Isosorbide Dinitrate Tablets BP 20mg UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p>
<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>The bioavailabilities of a conventional and two slow release 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) formulations were compared after oral administration in a three way cross-over study in 8 male volunteers. In a further group of 6 male volunteers the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ISDN were investigated after intravenous infusion of a median dose of 14.1 mg for 2.5 h. The median elimination half-lives of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and IS-5-MN-2-Glu were 0.7, 5.1, 3.2 and 2.5 h, respectively. Apart from IS-5-MN-2-Glu, with a renal clearance of 5.9 l/min which suggested substantial glucuronidation in the kidney, the renal clearances of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and the corresponding amounts excreted were negligible. 27.8% of the administered ISDN was excreted as IS-5-MN-2-Glu (8.7%) and IS (19.1%). Calculations based on the two mononitrate metabolites formed from ISDN showed an incomplete recovery of 84.1%, leading to the assumption that a simultaneous denitration to IS must have occurred. <br /><em>Abshagen U, Betzien G, Endele R et al.

Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em> </span>

                    <span>Levamisole is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations occur within 1.5 to 2 hours. It is extensively metabolised in the liver. The plasma half-life for levamisole is 3 to 4 hours and for the metabolites is 16 hours. It is excreted mainly in the urine as metabolites and a small proportion in the faeces.

                    <span>Mannitol is metabolized only very slightly, if at all, to glycogen in the liver. The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

In 7 (28%), treatment with MA was permanently discontinued due to serious adverse effects that included acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.

<p>The medical charts of 54 Ethiopian visceral leishmaniasis patients treated with meglumine antimoniate were reviewed to assess the effectiveness and safety profile in a routine healthcare setting. None of the patients from south Ethiopia (n=24) and 46.4% of the patients from north Ethiopia (n=30) were HIV co-infected. 33 non-serious and 6 serious adverse events (two pancreatitis, one renal failure and three deaths) were observed in 26 patients. One-third of the non-serious adverse events were due to biochemical pancreatitis. During treatment, a case-fatality rate of 10.0% in north Ethiopia and 0.0% in south Ethiopia was noted. These data point to clinical pancreatitis as a safety concern, especially in patients with HIV co-infection.<br /><em>Safety and effectiveness of meglumine antimoniate in the treatment of Ethiopian visceral leishmaniasis patients with and without HIV co-infection.

<p>Pancreatitis, occasionally fatal, has been reported in up to 2-3% of patients enrolled in monotherapy clinical studies of stavudine, and in &lt; 1% of patients in combination therapy studies including stavudine. Patients with a history of pancreatitis had an incidence of approximately 5% on stavudine, as compared to approximately 2% in patients without such a history. Patients with a high risk of pancreatitis or those receiving products known to be associated with pancreatitis should be closely followed for symptoms of this condition.<br /><em>Zerit&#174; (stavudine) capsules, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Limited, updated April 2011</em></p></span>

                      <span>This Interaction has not been studied. Based on limited data concerning metabolism, elimination and toxicity of melarsoprol, there is little potential for interaction, although due to the lack of data, vigilance is required if administering melarsoprol with antiretrovirals. It is unknown whether urinary metabolites of melarsoprol, such as arsenic, are excreted via active renal mechanisms, however a clinical study has reported that urinary pharmacokinetic parameters are not predictive of toxicity or therapeutic efficacy. Therefore stavudine has little potential to effect melarsoprol treatment via competition for renal elimination mechanisms.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol.

<p>This study enrolled 28 CNS-involved patients with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense at the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute (Alupe, Kenya) to examine treatment efficacy and toxicity of melarsoprol in relation to renal excretion/dose relationships. This study complied with World Health Organization treatment recommendations, initially treating with suramin followed by three courses of melarsoprol. Traced study patients had a relapse rate of 4.1%. The toxicity and crude death rate was 7.1%. Total urine arsenic output was measured between 24 and 48 hr after the last dose for each course. The range of means of total urine arsenic output between the three treatment courses was 356-511 micrograms. There was no correlation comparing melarsoprol dose, estimated creatine clearance, or urine arsenic output. Urinary pharmacokinetic parameters are not predictive of toxicity or therapeutic efficacy.<br /><em>Attempt to correlate urine arsenic excretion with clinical course during melarsoprol therapy of patients with Rhodesian trypanosomiasis.

Co-administration with other drugs which are predominantly eliminated by active renal transport may lead to competition for renal transporters and may raise exposure to either drug.

                    <span><p>Analagous to the physiological cysteine system, following intravenous administration, mesna is rapidly oxidised to its only metabolite, mesna disulphide. Mesna disulphide remains in the intravascular compartment and is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. In the kidney, mesna disulphide is reduced to the free thiol compound, mesna, which acts to detoxify ifosfamide metabolites. Approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and mesna disulphide respectively.<br /><em>Mesna Tablets/Injection US Prescribing Information, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, updated February 2009</em></p>
<p>Mesna and its dimer, dimesna, are coadministered for mitigation of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities, respectively. Dimesna is selectively reduced to mesna in the kidney, producing its protective effects. In vitro screens of uptake and efflux transporters revealed saturable uptake by renal organic anion transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OAT4. Efflux transporters breast cancer resistance protein; multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1); multidrug resistance proteins MRP1, MRP2, MRP4, and MRP5; and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) significantly reduced dimesna accumulation. Further investigation demonstrated that renal apical efflux transporters MATE1, MRP2, and Pgp were also capable of mesna efflux. Administration of OAT inhibitor probenecid to healthy subjects significantly increased combined mesna and dimesna plasma exposure (91% &#177; 34%) while decreasing the renal clearance due to net secretion (67.0% &#177; 12.7%) and steady-state volume of distribution (45.2% &#177; 13.4%). Thus, the kidney represents a significant sink of total mesna, whereas function of renal drug transporters facilitates clearance in excess of glomerular filtration rate and likely the presence of active mesna in the urine. Loss of renal transporter function due to genetic variability or drug-drug interactions may decrease the efficacy of chemoprotectants, increasing the risk of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities.<br /><em>In vitro and in vivo assessment of renal drug transporters in the disposition of mesna and dimesna.

                    <span><p>In vitro studies have shown that interactions between miltefosine and drugs which are metabolised by cytochrome P450, glucuronidated or otherwise conjugated are unlikely, however the possibility of interactions with commonly used drugs can not be totally excluded. No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em></p>
<p>A case report describes the first two patients to be treated with miltefosine for post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). One was a 26-year-old Ethiopian man who had been treated with sodium stibogluconate, for relapsing visceral leishmaniasis (VL), four times between August 2002 and March 2004. In January 2004 this patient was found to be seropositive for HIV and began antiretroviral treatment with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. Five months later he developed clinical PKDL, with extensive cutaneous, conjunctival and oral mucosal involvement. The second patient was a 42-year-old Ethiopian man who was treated for relapsing VL in November 2003. He too was subsequently found to be seropositive for HIV and was treated with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine from May 2004. He developed a nodular rash of PKDL over his face and upper body 2 weeks after starting the antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of both patients with oral miltefosine, at 100 mg/day for 28 days, led to the complete regression of their PKDL lesions. When checked 3-6 months after the end of the miltesofine treatment, neither patient showed any signs of VL, PKDL or other HIV-associated disease. Significant adverse events were not observed.<br /><em>Successful miltefosine treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis occurring during antiretroviral therapy.

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Up to 50% of a neostigmine dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys.

                    <span><p>Neostigmine undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterase and is also metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

Following a single 4-g dose of aminosalicylic acid in adults with normal renal function, approximately 77% of the dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours; 56% is excreted as the acetylated metabolite. Aminosalicylic acid and its acetyl metabolite accumulate in patients with severe renal disease. Continued acetylation of the parent drug leads exclusively to accumulation of the inactive acetylated form; deacetylation, if it occurs, is minor. <br /><em>Paser&#174; granules (aminosalicylic acid granules) US prescribing information, Jacobus Pharmaceutical Co.&nbsp; Last updated August 1996</em>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Up to 80% of a dose is excreted via the kidneys, predominantly as metabolites and rarely as unchanged drug. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions with stavudine via competition for active renal elimination pathways.</span>

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is not extensively metabolised in man. The drug is rapidly excreted in urine; however traces remain in the plasma after a single dose for up to 48 hours due to extensive protein binding. Penicillamine is eliminated primarily by metabolism to the disulphide which is excreted in the urine together with a small proportion of unchanged drug. Some of the dose is excreted as a penicillamine copper complex and some as the S-methyl derivative.<br /><em>Penicillamine 250mg Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Kent Pharmaceuticals Ltd, updated April 2012</em></p>
<p>About 80% of the absorbed dose is excreted rapidly in the urine, mostly as mixed disulphides. Some of the dose is excreted as a penicillamine copper complex and some as the S-methyl derivative.<br /><em>Distamine&#174; (Penicillamine) 250mg Film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Alliance Pharmaceuticals, updated June 2010</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin may decrease plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Conversely, enzyme inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and ketoconazole may increase plasma concentrations of praziquantel.

                    <span><div>To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (eg, plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh &gt;6). <br /><em>Zerit Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine.<br /><em>Effect of ribavirin on intracellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection: final results of a randomized clinical study.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>About 50% of a single dose of sulfadiazine given orally is excreted in the urine in 24 hours; 15 to 40% is excreted as the acetyl derivative. The urinary excretion of sulfadiazine and the acetyl derivative is dependent on pH. About 30% is excreted unchanged in both fast and slow acetylators when the urine is acidic whereas about 75% is excreted unchanged by slow acetylators when the urine is alkaline. The half-life of sulfadiazine ranges from 7 to 12 hours and that of its metabolite from 8 to 12 hours. There have been reports of crystalluria and renal failure associated with the use of sulfadiazine in immunocompromised patients, including the suggestion that AIDS patients may be particularly prone to sulfadiazine-induced renal toxicity<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>A case report decribes a patient with newly-diagnosed HIV infection and biopsy-proven cerebral toxoplasmosis treated with sulphadiazine 2 g six-hourly with pyrimethamine 50 mg once daily. Despite adequate hydration and daily examination of urine for sulphadiazine crystals, renal function deteriorated suddenly after 13 days of sulphadiazine therapy. Obstructive uropathy due to bilateral ureteric stones with hydronephrosis occurred, resulting in rapid onset renal failure. Sulphadiazine was discontinued and clindamycin was substituted. With intravenous fluid hydration and bilateral nephrostomies the urolithiasis resolved. Sulphadiazine and its hepatic metabolite acetylsulphadiazine are excreted via the renal tract; they are poorly soluble in urine and may potentially precipitate in the acid environment, producing crystalluria and stones. Crystalluria is common, may occur in up to 28% of patients taking sulphadiazine, and is potentially nephrotoxic via both direct chemical irritation of the tubular epithelium and tubular obstruction due to urolithiasis.&nbsp; The authors suggest that if outpatient treatment of toxoplasmosis is contemplated, careful attention to fluid balance, daily checking of urine for the presence of crystalluria, and frequent monitoring of biochemical renal function (3 times a week) are required in order to avoid this potentially serious complication of treatment.<br /><em>Sulphadiazine-induced obstructive renal failure complicating treatment of HIV-associated toxoplasmosis.

These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the extended release formulation of stavudine (d4T-XR 100 mg) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) were studied in 18 HIV-negative subjects.

The rate of timolol metabolism varies between individuals. Poor metabolisers (approximately 10%) show higher plasma levels and slower elimination of timolol than extensive metabolisers. Within individuals, however, plasma concentrations and half-life are reproducible. As the therapeutic response and some adverse effects are related to plasma concentrations of timolol, poor metabolisers may require lower than normal doses. <br /><em>Betim&#174; (Timolol) 10mg Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Meda Pharmaceuticals,updated October 2011</em></p>

                    <span>In vivo, triclabendazole is rapidly oxidised into its sulfoxide metabolite, which is further oxidised to the sulfone metabolite. The sulfoxide form is predominant in plasma, with the parent compound and the sulfone metabolite having AUCs respectively of approximately 1% and 10% of that of the sulfoxide. The rapid biotransformation of triclabendazole in man and the previous findings in animals produced evidence of presystemic biotransformation including first-pass metabolism of triclabendazole. In animals, the drug is largely excreted via the biliary tract in the faeces (90%), together with the sulfoxide and subsequently the sulfone metabolite. Less than 10% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Egaten&#174; Summary of product Charateristics, Novartis Pharma AG Basel, Switzerland, Produced July 2000</em></span>

                    <span><p>Vancomycin is metabolized only to a low extent. After parenteral administration it is excreted almost completely as microbiologically active substance (approx. 75-90% within 24 hours) through glomerular filtration via the kidneys. Biliary excretion is insignificant (less than 5% of a dose). The clearance of vancomycin from plasma correlates nearly with the glomerular filtration rate. No vancomycin metabolites have been identified so far in humans<br /><em>Vancomycin, 500 mg, powder for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Limited, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p>In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/hr, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/hr. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg. There is no apparent metabolism of the drug.<br /><em>Sterile vancomycin hydrochloride, USP Fliptop Vial For Intravenous Use, US Prescribing Information, Hospira Inc, updated December 2007</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine. <br /><em>Zerit Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2011.</em></p>
<p>Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. <br /><em>Zerit Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>Zidovudine in combination with stavudine is antagonistic in vitro. The concomitant use of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided. <br /><em>Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>Concomitant use of zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro. <br /><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The effect of adding stavudine (40 mg twice daily, n=35) to existing zidovudine therapy (300 mg twice daily) was studied in HIV-infected subjects and compared to those receiving stavudine monotherapy (40 mg twice daily, n=37). The most important finding in this study was that the combination of d4T and ZDV was inferior to d4T alone, with subjects receiving the combination showing progressive declines in CD4 cell counts over 16 weeks. Pharmacological antagonism between d4T and ZDV was the most likely mechanism. Intracellular d4T triphosphate concentrations were determined in 4 subjects receiving d4T alone and 2 subjects receiving d4T+ ZDV and were found to be lower when given in combination (65 vs. 10 fmol/10^6 cells).<br /><em>In vivo antagonism with zidovudine plus stavudine combination therapy.
