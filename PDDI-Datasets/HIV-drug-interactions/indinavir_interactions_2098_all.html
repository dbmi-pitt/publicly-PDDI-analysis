                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide.

Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

                    <span>A prospective, open-label, longitudinal, two-period study in seven healthy volunteers aimed to determine whether daily high-dose vitamin C alters the steady-state pharmacokinetics of indinavir. Indinavir 800mg every 8 hours was given to subjects for four doses on days 1 and 2. Plasma samples were then collected for indinavir pharmacokinetic determination. After a 7-day washout period, subjects were given vitamin C 1000mg/day for 7 days. Beginning on day 6 of vitamin C administration, indinavir 800mg every 8 hours was restarted for four doses. Plasma was then collected from subjects to determine indinavir pharmacokinetics. Mean steady-state indinavir C max was significantly reduced (20%) after 7 days of vitamin C administration (10.3 vs 8.2 micrograms/ml, p=0.04). The corresponding mean AUC 0-8 was also significantly decreased (14%; 26.4&nbsp; vs 22.7 micrograms*hr/ml, p=0.05). Although not statistically significant, the mean indinavir C min was 32% lower in the presence of vitamin C (0.27 vs 0.18 micrograms/ml, p=0.09). Indinavir oral clearance and half-life were not significantly different. Concomitant administration of high doses of vitamin C can reduce steady-state indinavir plasma concentrations; the clinical significance of these findings remain to be established.<br /><em>Slain D, Amsden JR, Khakoo RA et al.

                      <span>In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone -17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily)  and inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

                    <span>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. In an interaction study of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple-dose lopinavir/ritonavir, bedaquiline AUC was increased by 22%. This increase is likely due to ritonavir and increases in bedaquiline exposure would be expected when coadministered with other ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. The combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If coadministration is necessary, clinical monitoring including frequent electrocardiogram assessment and monitoring of transaminases is recommended. There are no clinical data on the safety and efficacy of bedaquiline when co-administered with antiretroviral agents.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Bupivacaine is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as indinavir may increase levels of bupivacaine.

                    <span><p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominately by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to PPX, both mediated by cytochrome P4503A4. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<div>The metabolism of indinavir is mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Therefore, other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of indinavir.Similarly, indinavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Boosted indinavir (indinavir with ritonavir) may have additive pharmacokinetic effects on substances that share the CYP3A4 pathway as both ritonavir and indinavir inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.<br /><em>CRIXIVAN&#174; (indinavir) hard capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated February 2012</em></div></div></span>

Indinavir and ritonavir inhibit CYP3A4 and as a result are expected to increase the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. Concomitant use of medicinal products that are inducers of CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, may reduce indinavir plasma concentrations. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when carbamazepine is concomitantly administered with indinavir or indinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, <em>February 2012</em>.</em></p>

<p>There is a case report of antiretroviral therapy failure caused by an interaction between indinavir and carbamazepine. The addition of carbamazepine (200 mg daily) to a regimen containing indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) resulted in a substantial decrease in indinavir concentrations. Concomitant use of carbamazepine and indinavir may cause antiretroviral therapy failure due to insufficient indinavir concentrations. Drugs other than carbamazepine should be considered. When alternative drugs are not possible, TDM of indinavir and careful clinical observation may help reduce adverse clinical consequences.<br /><em>Carbamazepine&#8211;indinavir interaction causes antiretroviral therapy failure.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

                    <span><div>The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. An alternative to clopidogrel should be considered.</span>

In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. As an inhibitor of CYP3A, indinavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.</span>

Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls. When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target. Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP). The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations. However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.

                    <span>Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of strong P-gp inhibitors (such as amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine, ketoconazole, dronedarone and clarithromycin) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations. Concomitant administration of a P-gp inducer (such as rifampicin, St. John&#180;s wort (Hypericum perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran concentrations and should be avoided. Protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, tipranavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir affect P-glycoprotein (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran.<br /><em>Pradaxa Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International, January 2013.</em> </span>

                    <span><div>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></div>

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<p>Delavirdine inhibits the metabolism of indinavir such that coadministration of 400-mg or 600-mg indinavir three times daily with 400-mg delavirdine three times daily alters indinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin. Coadministration of delavirdine (400 mg three time daily) and indinavir (400 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 28 subjects resulted in a 36% decrease in indinavir Cmax, no change in AUC and a ~2-fold increase in Cmin (when compared to indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone). Coadministration of delavirdine (400 mg three time daily) and indinavir (600 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 28 subjects resulted in no change in indinavir Cmax, a 53% increase in AUC and a ~4-fold increase in Cmin (when compared to indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone).

<p>When compared to indinavir 800 mg three times daily, coadministration of indinavir (600 mg three times daily) and delavirdine (400 mg three times daily) to 28 individuals resulted in no change in Cmax, a 53% increase in AUC and a 298% increase in Cmin. Coadministration of indinavir (400 mg three times daily) and delavirdine resulted in a 36% decrease in indinavir Cmax, no change in AUC and a 118% increase in Cmin when compared to 800 mg three times daily alone. There were no apparent changes in delavirdine pharmacokinetics when compared to historical data. A dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg three times daily should be considered when indinavir and delavirdine are coadministered. <br /><em>Rescriptor Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012. </em></p>
<p>The effect of a single dose of indinavir (400 or 600 mg) on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine (400 mg three times daily) was investigated in 14 healthy volunteers. Mean indinavir AUC (0-infinity) for 400 mg with delavirdine was only 14% lower than that obtained following 800 mg indinavir alone (29600 &#177; 7920 vs 25400 &#177; 6960 nM.h; 800 mg alone vs 400 mg with delavirdine). A 600 mg dose with delavirdine produced indinavir AUC (0-infinity) which were 44% greater than for 800 mg alone (29600 &#177; 7920 vs 42700 &#177; 9800 nM.h; 800 mg alone vs 600 mg with delavirdine). Delavirdine decreased indinavir Cmax (13200 &#177; 2590 vs 7560 &#177; 1160 nM; 800 mg alone vs 400 mg with delavirdine). Trough indinavir concentrations were increased in the presence of delavirdine (245 &#177; 212 vs 596 &#177; 380 nM; 800 mg alone vs 400 mg with delavirdine). Results indicated that single doses of indinavir had no clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine. Delavirdine has minimal effect on indinavir absorption, but decreases the oral clearance resulting in higher trough concentrations. Results support the possibility of a reduction in indinavir dosage or frequency of administration when given in combination with delavirdine. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions study of delavirdine and indinavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>No formal interaction study has been performed. A normal (acidic) gastric pH may be necessary for optimum absorption of indinavir whereas acid rapidly degrades didanosine which is formulated with buffering agents to increase pH. Antiretroviral activity was unaltered when didanosine was administered 3 hours after treatment with indinavir. Indinavir and didanosine formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach. Coadministration of enteric-coated didanosine (400 mg single dose) and indinavir (800 mg single dose) had no effect on indinavir or didanosine concentrations.

<p>Unlike the didanosine chewable/dispersible tablets, didanosine gastro-resistant capsules do not contain antacids and therefore drug interactions mediated by altered gastric pH are not anticipated when didanosine gastro-resistant capsules are co-administered with medicinal products where absorption is influenced by gastric acidity.

<p>Coadministration of didanosine EC (400 mg single dose) and indinavir (800 mg single dose) to 23 HIV-negative subjects resulted in no change in the AUC and Cmax of indinavir. When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg single dose) was coadministered simultaneously with indinavir (single dose) to 16 HIV-negative subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. When the same doses were administered 1 h apart (indinavir 1 h before didanosine), the AUC and Cmax of ddI decreased by 17% and 13% respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of single doses of enteric-coated ddI (400 mg) and indinavir/ritonavir (1200/400 mg) and the effect of food were investigated in 8 HIV-negative subjects. When given with food, the addition of ddI had no significant effect on indinavir AUC (5% decrease) or Cmax (3% decrease). However, when indinavir/ritonavir and didanosine were given two hours after food, there was no significant effect on indinavir AUC (5% decrease), but a 14% increase in IDV Cmax when compared to indinavir/ritonavir given alone and with food. When given two hours after food, the addition of indinavir/ritonavir significantly reduced ddI exposure (23% decrease in AUC, 42% decrease in Cmax). Coadministration with food resulted in a similar decrease in Cmax (46%), but lessened the effect on ddI AUC (4% decrease). If ddI and indinavir/ritonavir are used in combination, the most favourable pharmaockinetics are obtained if dosed with food. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction study of indinavir/ritonavir and the enteric-coated capsule formulation of didanosine in healthy volunteers. la Porte C, Verweij-van Wissen C, van Ewijk N, et al.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800mg three times daily) and a single dose of didanosine (400 mg given 1 hour before indinavir) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Didanosine had little effect on indinavir exposure when taken 1 h before indinavir. Administration of didanosine and indinavir should be separated by 1 h, although the gastric buffering effects of a 400 mg dose of didanosine appears to persist for ~90 minutes.<br /><em>If taken 1 hour before indinavir, didanosine does not affect indinavir exposure despite persistent buffering effects.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydrocodeine is converted to dihydromorphine (active metabolite) via CYP2D6, to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide via UGT2B7 (major pathway) and to nordihydrocodeine via CYP3A4. The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase dihydrocodeine exposure (inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) and increase the conversion to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide (induction of UGT2B7). The net clinical effect of this interaction is difficult to predict. Monitor the analgesic effect and for signs of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted.

When compared to indinavir (800 mg three times daily), coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 46% and Cmin by 57%. Coadministration of a lower dose of efavirenz (200 mg once daily) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 31% and Cmin by 40%; efavirenz AUC was unchanged. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 twice daily) had no effect on efavirenz AUC or Cmin. Indinavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 25% and 50%; ritonavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 36% and 39%. No specific dose recommendation can be given for indinavir alone. Dose increases of indinavir/ritonavir when given in combination with efavirenz have not been studied. <br /><em>Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, <em>February 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily for 10 days) to 20 HIV+ subjects resulted in no change in indinavir Cmax for the morning and afternoon doses and a 29% decrease for the evening dose. Indinavir AUC decreased by 33-37% for the morning and afternoon doses, and by 46% for the evening dose. Indinavir Cmin decrease by 39%, 52% and 57% for the morning, afternoon and evening doses respectively. There were no significant changes in efavirenz Cmax or AUC. The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>When indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given with efavirenz (200 mg every 24 hours), indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 31% and 40% respectively. A similar reduction in indinavir exposures was observed when indinavir 1000 mg every 8 hours was given with efavirenz 600 mg daily. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed for efavirenz. While the clinical significance of decreased indinavir concentrations has not been established, the magnitude of the observed pharmacokinetic interaction should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen containing both efavirenz and indinavir. No adjustment of the dose of efavirenz is necessary when given with indinavir. <br />When efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was given with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily), indinavir AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were decreased by approximately 25%, 50% and 17%, respectively, compared to indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily given without efavirenz. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed for efavirenz. The geometric mean Cmin for indinavir (0.33 mg/L) when given with ritonavir and efavirenz was higher than the mean historical Cmin (0.15 mg/L) when indinavir was given alone at 800 mg every 8 hours. In HIV-1 infected patients (n=6), the pharmacokinetics of indinavir and efavirenz were generally comparable to these uninfected volunteer data. No adjustment of the dose of efavirenz is necessary when given with indinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg every 8 hours) and efavirenz (600 mg), was studied in 20 subjects. When compared to values obtained with indinavir alone (800 mg every 8 hours), no alteration in indinavir Cmax was observed after the morning or afternoon dose, whereas a 29% reduction was observed following the evening dose. Indinavir AUC was reduced by 33%, 37% and 46% and Cmin was reduced by 39%, 52% and 57% following morning, afternoon and evening doses, respectively. No alterations in efavirenz Cmax, AUC or Cmin were observed when efavirenz (200 mg once daily for 14 days) was given with indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours for 14 days) to 11 subjects. The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. When indinavir at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.<br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Adequate indinavir concentrations were described in 29-year old HIV+ Thai male receiving indinavir/ritonavir with efavirenz and rifampicin. Prior to the introduction of rifampicin-based TB therapy, the patient had been receiving indinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). Indinavir trough and peakl plasma concentrations were 1.73 mg/L and 11.21 mg/L, respectively; efavirenz concentration determined mid-dose was 1.06 mg/L. Following the introduction of rifampicin, indinavir/ritonavir was maintained at 600/100 mg, giving indinavir trough and peak concentrations of 0.26 and 4.66 mg/L, respectively. Efavirenz was increased to 800 mg once daily, giving a mid-dose efavirenz concentration of 4.69 mg/L. After completion of TB therapy, the efavirenz dose was reduced to 600 mg. Although indinavir concentrations were significantly reduced, they were still compatible with clinical efficacy, as well as improved tolerability and safety. The reduction in indinavir concentrations was associated with improved renal function and the increased efavirenz dose was well tolerated. Indinavir has generally not been combined with rifampicin because of significant reductions in indinavir concentrations. However, it may be possible, especially with low body weight, to use indinavir at the usual dose (800/100 mg twice daily) in the presence of rifampicin and achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect despite enzymic induction.<br /><em>Maintenance of successful ritonavir-boosted indinavir and efavirenz therapy in an HIV-infected patient with tuberculosis.

<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg twice daily) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Neither indinavir nor RTV parameters were significantly changed in the presence of efavirenz. Indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were 2.9 vs 2.6 mg/L, 17.6 vs 16.2 mg/L.h, and 0.5 vs 0.4 mg/L, alone vs combination respectively. Ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were 6.6 vs 5.0 mg/L, 42.8 vs 37.7 mg/L.h, and 1.7 vs 1.7 mg/L, alone vs combination respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles of indinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz were comparable to historical data. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of indinavir and ritonavir +/- efavirenz in HIV-infected patients.

<p>A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 6 HIV patients receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). The geometric mean indinavir Cmin was 0.32 mg/L (95% CI 0.13-0.82) and was lower than had been previously reported for indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) without efavirenz. Cmin values were above the target of 0.15 mg/L in 5/6 patients. The geometric mean Cmin for efavirenz at 24 h was 2.7 mg/L (95% CI 1.3-5.7) and was higher than described in product literature (1.8 mg/L). Efavirenz Cmin was above the minimum target value of 1.0 mg/L in all 6 subjects; 2 subjects had concentrations above the upper target of 4.0 mg/L. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice a day) combined with efavirenz in HIV-infected patients.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (400, 600 or 800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was studied in 6 HIV+ subjects, 5 of whom were also taking efavirenz. Evening indinavir trough concentrations were 141 ng/ml (400 mg), 248 ng/ml (600 mg) and 474 ng/ml (800 mg); evening trough concentrations were 56% lower than morning trough concentrations. Evening troughs were above an efficacy threshold of 150 ng/ml in all subjects on 800 mg, but were below target in one subject on 600 mg and four subjects on 400 mg. Indinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg should be avoided in patients taking efavirenz. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of standard and lower dose indinavir administered with ritonavir 100 mg in Asian HIV-infected patients.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of indinavir was assessed in HIV+ subjects receiving indinavir 1000 mg three times daily with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, or indinavir/efavirenz 1200/300 mg twice daily (alone and in combination with abacavir). The twice daily indinavir regimen tended toward a higher Cmax and lower Cmin compared to those for indinavir 1000 mg three times daily. The median Cmin obtained with the twice daily regimen was 54 ng/ml and was inadequate based on a target range of 80-120 ng/ml. <br /><em>Indinavir, efavirenz and abacavir pharmacokinetics in human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects.

<p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were evaluated in 20 HIV+ Thai subjects. Indinavir geometric mean (with 95% CI) AUC, Cmin and Cmax were 45.7 (39.8-52.5) mg/L.h, 0.32 ( 0.24-0.44) mg/L and 11.1 (9.4-13.0) mg/L respectively. A &gt;10-fold variation in Cmin was observed, but all were at least comparable to those obtained following indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone. Efavirenz geometric mean Cmin at 24 h was 2.1 mg/L (95% CI 1.6-2.6 mg/L) and was 30-35% higher than previously reported in healthy volunteers. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg in combination with efavirenz (600 mg) in HIV-1 infected subjects.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg bd) to 14 healthy volunteers resulted in significant decreases in indinavir AUC (-25%), Cmin (-50%) and Cmax (-17%). Cmin values were similar to those obtained with 800 mg indinavir given three times daily without ritonavir. Efavirenz concentrations were comparable to historical data.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (200 mg once daily) and indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) resulted in a 31% decrease in indinavir AUC, a 16% decrease in indinavir Cmax and a 40% decrease in Ctrough. When efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) were given to healthy volunteers, indinavir AUC and Ctrough decreased 33-46% and 39-57% respectively when compared to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily).

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Empagliflozin is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A3, 1A8, 1A9 and 2B7. It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as ritonavir&nbsp;may reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required. An effect on concentrations of indinavir is unlikely as empagliflozin does not inhibit or induce CYPs and does not inhibit UGTs.</p></span>

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Etonogestrel is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and etonogestrel implants increased etonogestrel exposure (52%, 61%, and 34% increases in AUC, Cmax, and Cmin, respectively) suggesting that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of etonogestrel implants. Similarly, coadministration with indinavir could potentially increase etonogestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only etonogestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception. </span>

<p>Coadministration of fluconazole (400 mg once daily for 8 days) and indinavir (1000 mg three time daily for 7 days) to 11 HIV+ subjects results in decreases in indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 13%, 24% and 10% respectively. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Two studies of the coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg every 8 h) and fluconazole (400 mg once daily) were performed, one in HIV+ individuals and the other in healthy volunteers. Both studies found that indinavir had no statistically or clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole. There was a moderately significant (p=0.08) decrease in indinavir AUC, but no statistically or clinically significant effect on indinavir Cmax and Cmin. Although the values of the pharmacokinetic parameters for indinavir decrease in the presence of fluconazole, the two drugs can be administered concomitantly without adjustment of the dose of either drug.<br /><em>Effect of fluconazole on indinavir pharmacokinetics in human immunodeficiency virus&#8211;infected patients.

<p><em><strong>LHPG Comment:</strong> Note that the study was performed with indinavir 1000 mg every 8 h. A decrease of 20% is likely to be relevant in a non&#8211;boosted regimen.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Fluphenazine is predominantly metabolized via CYP2D6. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction with indinavir alone. Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levels of fluphenazine via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing the likelihood of adverse events such as severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects.</span>

<p>Data were available on four HIV+ patients receiving fluvastatin and indinavir (800 mg three times daily). After initiation of fluvastatin, no significant changes in indinavir levels at 2-4 h post dose were detected (baseline, 5672 &#177; 5109 ng/ml; week 12, 2908 &#177; 3137 ng/ml; mean &#177; sd, n=4). Two patients had to interrupt indinavir therapy due to nephrotoxicity and virological failure. Average concentrations in the two remaining patients were 7895 ng/ml (week 36), 9749 ng/ml (week 48), 6191 ng/ml (week 60) and 3078 ng/ml (week 72). <br /><em>Lipid lowering therapy with fluvastatin and pravastatin in patients with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy: comparison of efficacy and interaction with indinavir.

                    <span><p>Coadministration with indinavir (1200 mg twice daily) and amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 90% and had no effect on indinavir concentrations. There are no interaction data available on the coadministration of indinavir/ritonavir and amprenavir. Coadministration of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 64% (relative to amprenavir 1200 mg twice daily alone). Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Ritonavir oral solution should not be co-administered with amprenavir oral solution to children due to the risk of toxicity from excipients in the two formulations. No data with fosamprenavir. <br /><em>Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>No drug interaction studies have been undertaken with&nbsp;fosamprenavir/ritonavir and indinavir.&nbsp;No dosage recommendations can be given. According to current treatment guidelines, dual therapy with protease inhibitors is generally not recommended. <br /><em>Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, May 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) and amprenavir (750 or 800 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) to 9 subjects resulted in increases in amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 18%, 33% and 25% respectively. The effect of amprenavir on indinavir concentrations is not well established. When compared with historical data, indinavir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin decreased by 22%, 38%, and 27%, respectively. Appropriate doses of the combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. The interaction between indinavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Concentrations of indinavir, amprenavir and ritonavir were determined in 8 HIV- subjects receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) alone or in combination with fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily). Addition of fosamprenavir decreased indinavir AUC (30%), Cmax (20%) and Cmin (20%), but these changes were not statistically significant. Ritonavir exposure was not significantly affected and amprenavir concentrations were similar to historic controls. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of an indinavir/ritonavir fosamprenavir regimen in HIV-infected individuals.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Indinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier). Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of indinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as indinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Approximately 70-80% of the dose of cilastatin was recovered unchanged in the urine as cilastatin within 10 hours of administration of imipenem/cilastatin. No further cilastatin appeared in the urine thereafter. Approximately 10% was found as the N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase comparable to that of cilastatin. Activity of dehydropeptidase-I in the kidney returned to normal levels shortly after the elimination of cilastatin from the blood stream.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em> </span>

Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when ketoconazole is concomitantly administered with indinavir/ritonavir. Dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when indinavir is administered without ritonavir.

<p>Coadministration of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily for 7 days), lamivudine (150 mg three times daily for 7 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily) to 6 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases of 5% and 4% for indinavir Cmax and AUC, and a decrease of 2% for Cmin.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Similarly, indinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>Administration of indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) with methadone (20 mg to 60 mg daily) for one week in 10 subjects on methadone maintenance resulted in decreases of 7% and 4% for methadone Cmax and AUC, and a 6% increase in methadone Cmin.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) and methadone (20&#8211;60 mg once daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. There was no significant effect of indinavir on methadone AUC when compared to historical controls. When compared to historical controls, there was no significant effect of methadone on the AUC of indinavir, a 16&#8211;36% decrease in indinavir Cmax and a 50&#8211;100% increase in indinavir Cmin. The increase in trough indinavir and small decrease in indinavir Cmin would not be expected to adversely affect the efficacy of safety of indinavir.

Coadministration has not been studied, but combined administrations are expected to significantly increase concentrations of midazolam, particularly when midazolam is given orally. Caution should be used with co-administration of indinavir or indinavir/ritonavir and PARENTERAL midazolam. If co-administered with PARENTERAL midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit with close clinical monitoring in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.

<p>Coadministration with ORAL midazolam is contraindicated due to potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration with indinavir with or without ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of indinavir with benzodiazepines. Based on data from other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore indinavir should not be co-administered with ORALLY administered midazolam, whereas caution should be used with coadministration of indinavir and PARENTERAL midazolam. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If indinavir with or without ritonavir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p></span>

                      <span>The European SPC advises caution and increased clinical monitoring if administered with PARENTERAL midazolam. Coadministration of PARENTERAL midazolam should be done with caution and in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.

Coadministration has not been studied, but combined administrations are expected to significantly increase concentrations of midazolam, particularly when midazolam is given orally. Caution should be used with co-administration of indinavir or indinavir/ritonavir and PARENTERAL midazolam. If co-administered with PARENTERAL midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit with close clinical monitoring in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.

<p>Coadministration with ORAL midazolam is contraindicated due to potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration with indinavir with or without ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co-administration of indinavir with benzodiazepines. Based on data from other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore indinavir should not be co-administered with ORALLY administered midazolam, whereas caution should be used with coadministration of indinavir and PARENTERAL midazolam. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If indinavir with or without ritonavir is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p></span>

<p>Indinavir pharmacokinetics were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers both alone (800 mg three times daily) and after administration of milk thistle (160 mg three daily for 12 days). Milk thistle had no apparent effect on indinavir pharmacokinetics. After administration of milk thistle, geometric mean indinavir AUC decreased from 20.7 (15.3-29.2) mg/L.h to 19.4 (15.8-23.6)mg/L.h and Cmin decreased from 0.340 (0.232-0.497) mg/L to 0.232 (0.129-0.419) mg/L.

<p>In an <em>in vitro</em> study there was the potential for milk thistle to inhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4 and UGT1A substrates in human liver.

In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam.

<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily), and indinavir (1000 and 1200 mg twice daily) with nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) were investigated in HIV+ subjects. In the indinavir alone group, indinavir trough concentrations (median with range) at the start and end of the dosing interval were 369 (&lt;10-949) ng/ml and 159 (85-506) n/ml respectively; Cmax and AUC were 5508 (2864-19786) ng/ml and 16715 (5705-28084) ng/ml.h respectively. Following coadministration of indinavir 1000 mg with nelfinavir, indinavir trough concentrations (median with range) at the start and end of the dosing interval were &lt;10 (&lt;10-3740) ng/ml and 44 (&lt;10-4236) n/ml respectively; Cmax and AUC were 10740 (3379-18210) ng/ml and 38863 (10623-135665) ng/ml.h respectively. Following coadministration of indinavir 1200 mg with nelfinavir, indinavir trough concentrations (median with range) at the start and end of the dosing interval were 146(58-5215) ng/ml and 95 (12-954) n/ml respectively; Cmax and AUC were 9675 (6154-18198) ng/ml and 26901 (19139-63595) ng/ml.h respectively. Median indinavir clearance was significantly lower in the nelfinavir group (34.1 L/h, IQR 22.6-45.8) than in the indinavir alone group (47.9 L/h, IQR 42.7-70.3). Nelfinavir exposures were similar regardless of indinavir dose (Ctrough, 1779 vs 1805 ng/ml; Cmax, 5826 vs 5641 ng/ml; AUC 33106 vs 33269 ng/ml.h; median, 1000 mg vs 1200 mg). There was a higher incidence of indinavir trough concentrations below the limit of detection in the 1000 mg group (6/10, 60%) than in the 1200 mg group (0/7) or in the alone group (1/8 (12.5%), suggesting that 1200 mg indinavir appears to be the preferred dose in a twice daily regimen that includes nelfinavir.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir with nelfinavir to HIV+ subjects resulted in modest inhibition of indinavir elimination. Pharmacokinetic parameters following indinavir/nelfinavir (1200/1250 mg twice daily, n=11) were comparable to those following indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily, n=16): Cmin 0.15&#177;0.11 vs 0.18&#177;0.16 mg/L; Cmax 7.73&#177;2.46 vs 8.59&#177;2.52 mg/L; AUC(0-24) 56.53&#177;20.99 vs 66.91&#177;14.98 mg/L.h (mean&#177;sd, alone vs with nelfinavir). Indinavir had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of nelfinavir. The combination was generally well tolerated and resulted in sustained virological suppression with 45% of subjects having a viral load &lt;400 copies/ml at week 72 (intent-to-treat). <br /><em>Coadministration of indinavir and nelfinavir in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected adults: safety, pharmacokinetics and antiretroviral activity.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir 1000 mg and nelfinavir 1250 mg both given twice daily was evaluated in a pharmacokinetic substudy of ACTG388.

Indinavir appeared to inhibit the elimination of nelfinavir and may allow less frequent dosing of nelfinavir in some patients.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (1200 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) was studied in nine HIV+ individuals. When compared with nelfinavir historical controls (750 mg three times daily), there was a 27% increase in the daily AUC of nelfinavir, a 36% increase in Cmax and no change in Cmin in the presence of indinavir. When compared with indinavir historical controls (800 mg, three times daily), there was a 12% increase in the daily AUC of indinavir, no change in Cmax and a 16% increase in Cmin. Nelfinavir plasma levels were not obviously affected by indinavir; indinavir peak, trough and AUC values were comparable to indinavir 800 mg given three times daily alone.

<p>A study in six healthy volunteers investigated the coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and a single dose of nelfinavir (750 mg).

Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) and nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) was assessed in HIV+ patients as part of the Tianon-ANRS081 study. Indinavir median Cmin were lower in the nevirapine group at week 8 (72 vs 96 ng/ml, P=0.05, n=134) and at week 24 (72 vs 87 ng/ml, P=0.11, n=103); indinavir median Cmax did not differ between the two groups at week 8 or week 24.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and indinavir (1000 mg every 8 h) was studied in 54 HIV+ individuals receiving nevirapine, indinavir and stavudine and compared to indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) in 70 HIV+ individuals receiving indinavir, stavudine and lamivudine. Indinavir had no significant effect on nevirapine concentrations, however the pharmacokinetics of indinavir suggest that a dose increase to at least 1000 mg every 8 h may be required when coadministered with nevirapine. Cmin and Cmax following indinavir 800 mg were 266 &#177; 91 and 8402 &#177; 444 ng/ml, respectively. Following coadministration of indinavir 1000 mg every 8 h with nevirapine, indinavir Cmin and Cmax were 105 &#177; 21 and 8354 &#177; 535 ng/ml, respectively (mean &#177; sem). <br /><em>Launay O, Peytavin G, Landre P, et al. 40th ICAAC, Toronto, September 2000, presentation 1632.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) was studied in 19 HIV+ individuals. There was a ~27% reduction in indinavir AUC, a ~11% reduction in Cmax and a 47.5% reduction in Cmin. The data in this study do not support changing the indinavir dose on the basis of pharmacokinetic changes alone. Despite significant pharmacokinetic interactions, the combination of these drugs at the standard doses is associated with sustained and potent antiviral activity. <br /><em>Antiviral effect and pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and indinavir in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) was studied in 17 HIV+ individuals. Indinavir Cmax decreased by 26% following the afternoon dose and by 51% following the morning dose when compared to historical controls. There was a 43% decrease in indinavir Cmin. Nevirapine Cmax and Cmin did not differ significantly from historical controls. The clinical implication of this pharmacokinetic interaction and the role of dosage adjustment for indinavir merit further study. <br /><em>A pilot study of nevirapine, indinavir and lamivudine among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease who have had failure of combination therapy.

<p><strong>Indinavir + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>A retrospective analysis was performed on all samples in the Dutch TDM programme to identify those HIV+ subjects receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) alone (n=139) or in combination with nevirapine (200 mg twice daily; n=21). Indinavir geometric mean Cmin was 0.49 mg/L (95% CI, 0.35-0.6 8mg/L) in the nevirapine group versus 1.14 mg/L (95% CI, 1.00-1.29 mg/L) in the control group (57% difference, P&lt;0.001). No subject in either group had an indinavir Cmin below the proposed minimum effective level (0.10 mg/L). Ritonavir Cmin values were also lower in the nevirapine group than in the control group; 0.22 (0.15-0.31) mg/L vs 0.52 (0.46-0.60) mg/ml; nevirapine vs alone, 58% difference, P&lt;0.001. The effect of nevirapine may be either directly on indinavir or indirectly through the effect on ritonavir. In treatment-na&#239;ve patients there appears to be no need to modify the dose. In treatment-experienced patients, or when viral susceptibility to indinavir may be decreased, dose increase of indinavir to 1000 mg or ritonavir to 200 mg could be considered. <br /><em>The effect of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg bid.

Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms. Drug therapy at that time consisted of nifedipine (60 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), losartan (50 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and abacavir (300 mg twice daily). Discontinuation of atenolol, and nifedipine dosage reduction to 30 mg/day were effective in managing his orthostatic changes.<br /><em>Symptomatic Orthostasis With Extended-Release Nifedipine and Protease Inhibitors.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA.

<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but could increase oxycodone concentrations. Oxycodone is metabolised principally to noroxycodone via CYP3A and oxymorphone via CYP2D6. Oxymorphone has some analgesic activity but is present in the plasma in low concentrations and is not considered to contribute to oxycodone's pharmacological effect. Coadministration a single dose of oxycodone (10 mg) and ritonavir (300 mg twice daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) increased the AUC of oxycodone by 3.0- and 2.6-fold, respectively.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

Indinavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of phenytoin. Ritonavir induces oxidation by CYP2C9 and glucuronidation and as a result is expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of phenytoin. Phenytoin may decrease serum levels of ritonavir.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect.

<p>Data were available on four HIV+ patients receiving pravastatin and indinavir (alone or with ritonavir). After initiation of pravastatin, no significant changes in indinavir levels at 2-4 h post dose were detected (baseline, 4080 &#177; 3429 ng/ml; week 12, 5883 &#177; 4159 ng/ml; week 24, 4325 &#177; 4183 ng/ml; week 36, 1053 &#177; 1204 ng/ml; week 60 1992 &#177; 1682 ng/ml; week 72, 1595 &#177; 1642; mean &#177; sd, n=3 or 4). One patient had to stop indinavir therapy due to nephrotoxicity. There was no difference between indinavir alone and indinavir with ritonavir regimens and also no effect on ritonavir plasma concentrations. <br /><em>Lipid lowering therapy with fluvastatin and pravastatin in patients with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy: comparison of efficacy and interaction with indinavir.

<p>The effect of pravastatin (40 mg once daily) on the pharmokinetics of indinavir was evaluated in 5 HIV+ patients. Indinavir trough median concentrations were 116 and 149 ng/ml, prior to and 24 weeks after commencement of pravastatin respectively. No impact of pravastatin on indinavir concentrations was seen; efficacy and lack of interactions suggest this agent to be first line choice in hypercholesterolaemia in persons receiving PI-based HAART.<br /><em>Pravastatin 40 mg qd does not alter protease inhibitor exposure or virological efficacy over 24 weeks therapy.

Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls. When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target. Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP). The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations. However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Prednisone is converted to the active metabolite prednisolone by 11-B-hydroxydehydrogenase. Prednisolone is then metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration could potentially increase prednisolone concentrations thus increasing the risk of steroid related toxicity. Careful monitoring for adverse effects is recommended. The effect of CHOP chemotherapy (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) on indinavir (800 mg three times daily) was investigated in 7 HIV+ subjects. Indinavir concentrations with CHOP were similar to historical controls, but trough concentrations were below target in 2/7 subjects.

                    <span><p>The effect of CHOP chemotherapy (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) for non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) on the pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving indinavir (800 mg three times daily, n=7) or nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily, n=3). Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls.  When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target.  Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP).  The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations.  However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.

Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The AUCs of single dose atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) were significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral treatment containing atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz than in healthy volunteers. The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 and other boosted PIs could possibly decrease proguanil exposure via the same mechanism. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Propofol is glucuronidated via UGTs 1A9 and 1A8, and is oxidized mainly via CYP2B6. In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease propofol concentrations. The extent of this interaction is difficult to predict as propofol is a high hepatic extraction drug and therefore its rate of hepatic elimination is in theory more dependent on liver blood flow. Monitor effect. Indinavir alone is unlikely to alter propofol concentrations.</span>

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites.

Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral doses and are converted to the active forms pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate. They are stored mainly in the liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites which are excreted in the urine. As the dose increases, proportionally greater amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span><p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV. HIV-protease inhibitors alter retinoic acid synthesis. AIDS. 2001 Oct 19;15(15):1979-84.</em></p>
<p>Indinavir and retinoids have been associated with nail, skin, and hair defects, suggesting that indinavir and retinoids may exert their effects through similar molecular mechanisms. This hypothesis was tested by examining the effects of PIs on retinoid signaling in vitro. Mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2) were cultured in the presence of PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) and synthetic retinoids, and the metabolic response was assessed by measuring the activity of a retinoid-regulated protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Of the PIs tested, only indinavir stimulated ATRA-dependent ALP activity and altered stem cell morphology; the effects of indinavir occurred in the presence of ATRA, but not in its absence. Indinavir increased the effects of ATRA on lipid accumulation during fat cell differentiation. AGN 193109 a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist, inhibited the synergistic effects of indinavir and ATRA, indicating that indinavir increases RAR signaling. However, indinavir did not potentiate ALP activity in the presence of the RAR agonist CH55. These observations support the proposal that altered retinoid signaling promotes some of the adverse reactions associated with indinavir therapy, such as altered lipid metabolism.<br /><em>Lenhard JM, Weiel JE, Paulik MA, Furfine ES.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor whereas rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of most boosted protease inhibitors. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration of rifabutin with indinavir alone decreased indinavir exposure and increased rifabutin exposure. A dosage reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dosage increase of indinavir to 1000-1200 mg every 8 hours is suggested when rifabutin is co-administered with indinavir alone. </span>

<p>Dose reduction of rifabutin and dose increase of indinavir has not been confirmed in clinical studies. No dose recommendations for indinavir/ritonavir with rifabutin could be given. Therefore co-administration is not recommended. If rifabutin treatment is required, alternative agents for treating HIV infection should be sought. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) decrease indinavir AUC by 34% and Cmin by 39%; rifabutin AUC increased by 173% and Cmin increased by 244%. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (150 mg once daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 32% and decreased Cmin by 40%. When compared to rifabutin 300 mg once daily alone, rifabutin AUC increased by 54% and Cmin increased by 99%. No data has been obtained comparing rifabutin 150 mg once daily in combination with indinavir 800 mg three times daily with a reference dose of 150 mg rifabutin alone. The interaction with indinavir/ritonavir has not been studied.

<p>Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 10 days) to 14 subjects resulted in decreases in indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 20%, 32% and 40% respectively. Rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 29%, 54% and 99% respectively when compared to values obtained following administration of 300 mg once daily alone for 11 days. Coadministration of rifabutin (300mg once daily for 10 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 10 days) to 10 subjects resulted in decreases in indinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 25%, 34% and 29% respectively. Rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.3-, 2.7- and 3.4-fold respectively. Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of indinavir to 1000 mg every 8 hours are recommended when rifabutin and indinavir are coadministered. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (150 mg daily) to 18 healthy volunteers and 10 HIV+ subjects resulted in an indinavir AUC similar to that obtained following 800 mg three times daily alone. Rifabutin and 25-desacety lrifabutin AUCs when coadministered with indinavir were 70% and 120% higher than with rifabutin 300 mg alone. Increasing indinavir to 1000 mg three times daily compensates for rifabutin induction of indinavir metabolism. The clinical significance of the increase in rifabutin and 25-desacetyl rifabutin, despite a 50% dose reduction, is not known. <br /><em>Steady-state pharmacokinetic interaction of modified-dose indinavir and rifabutin.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) was studied in 10 healthy volunteers. The geometric mean ratio (GMR; combination compared to alone; 1= no effect) for indinavir AUC was 066 (90% CI, 0.56-0.77) and for rifabutin AUC was 2.73 (95% CI, 1.9-3.77). Coadministration of indinavir with rifabutin (150 mg once daily) resulted in a GMR for indinavir AUC of 0.68 (95% CI 0.60-0.76), while that of rifabutin (compared to 300 mg alone) was 1.54 (95% CI 1.33-1.79). <br /><em>Indinavir and rifabutin drug interactions in healthy volunteers.

<p>In a study, indinavir 1000 mg three times daily and rifabutin 150 mg gave an AUC of indinavir similar to that of indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). There was no change in steady-state pharmacokinetics of rifabutin or its metabolite 25&#8211;desacetyl rifabutin when the two drugs were given simultaneously or staggered. There was an increase in AUC of rifabutin (150mg) and metabolite with indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) of 60% and 125% compared with rifabutin alone. This occurred even with a 50% reduction in rifabutin dose, which is recommended with indinavir.<br /><em>Steady-state pharmacokinetic interaction of modified&#8211;dose indinavir and rifabutin.

<p>A study of HIV + individuals taking rifabutin and HAART concurrently were investigated for the effects of rifabutin on PIs (namely indinavir and nelfinavir). It was concluded that rifabutin could be given with PIs with successful clinical response in HIV and TB disease without an increase in side effects. Indinavir dose must be increased from 800 mg three times daily to 1200 mg three times daily.

                    <span><p>The use of rifampicin with indinavir or indinavir/ritonavir is contraindicated. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and rifampicin (600 mg once daily) decreased indinavir AUC by 92%. This effect is due to an induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin and can result in virological failure and resistance development. The interaction with indinavir/ritonavir has not been studied. During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen. <br /><em>Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, <em>February 2012</em>.</em> 
<p>
<p>Rifampicin should not be coadministered with indinavir as this may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to indinavir or the class of protease inhibitors or other coadministered antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 8 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 12 subjects resulted in decreases in indinavir Cmax and AUC of 87% and 92% respectively. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of a higher dose of indinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with rifampicin (and 2 NRTIs) was studied in Thai patients. Indinavir pharmacokinetics were obtained at week 2 and trough concentrations were determined at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Indinavir/ritonavir was reduced to the Thai standard of 400/100 mg twice daily after discontinuation of rifampicin with trough concentrations being obtained at least 4 weeks after dose reduction. Geometric mean (90% CI) indinavir AUC at week 2 was 8.11 (5.56-11.82) mg/L.h. Geometric mean (90% CI) trough concentration at week 2 was 0.03 (0.02-0.04) mg/L. Geometric mean trough concentration after stopping rifampicin and subsequent dose reduction was 0.68 mg/L (p=0.004). Rifampicin had a significant effect on indinavir concentrations resulting in suboptimal concentrations, despite which the majority of patients had undetectable viral load (&lt;50 copies/ml). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics, safety and 24 weeks efficacy of ritonavir-boosted indinavir (600/100 mg bid) in HIV/TB co-infected Thai patients receiving rifampicin.

<p>A study was performed in 6 HIV+ patients to evaluate whether the inducing effect of rifampicin could be overcome by the inhibitory effect of ritonavir. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed at steady stated following administration of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) before and after administration of rifampicin (300 mg once daily for 4 days). Reductions in median concentrations were seen 12 h after the last dose of rifampicin; indinavir concentrations reduced by 87% (from 837 to 112 ng/ml) and ritonavir concentrations by 94% (from 431 to 27 ng/ml). These results strongly indicate that the administration of rifampicin with indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) could lead to subtherapeutic concentrations of indinavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between rifampicin and the combination of indinavir and low-dose ritonavir in HIV-infected patients.

<p>The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Preliminary clinical data suggest that indinavir 400 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg, both administered orally twice daily, may be an alternative dosing regimen. A boosted dose of 800 mg indinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice daily results in increased risk of adverse events. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg twice daily) was studied with different doses of ritonavir (100-400 mg twice daily) and compared to historical data from indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Coadministration with ritonavir 100 mg increased indinavir AUC by 178% and Cmin by 11-fold; ritonavir AUC increased by 72% and Cmin increased by 62%. Coadministration with ritonavir 200 mg increased indinavir AUC by 266% and Cmin by 24-fold; ritonavir AUC increased by 96% and Cmin increased by 371%. Coadministration with ritonavir 400 mg increased indinavir AUC by 220% and Cmin by 24-fold; ritonavir AUC was unchanged. Coadministration of a lower dose of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 or 100 mg twice daily) was also compared to historical data from indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Coadministration with ritonavir 400 mg increased indinavir AUC by 68% and Cmin by 10-fold; there was no effect on ritonavir concentrations. Coadministration with ritonavir 100 mg resulted in AUC and Cmin values for indinavir that were comparable to the reference regimen. Indinavir should not be given with ritonavir to patients with decompensated liver disease as ritonavir is principally metabolised and eliminated by the liver.<br /><em>Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, <em>February 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Compared to historical data in patients who received indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours alone, twice-daily coadministration to volunteers of indinavir 800 mg and 100 mg ritonavir with food for two weeks resulted in an 2.7-fold increase of indinavir AUC, a 1.6-fold increase in Cmax, and an 11-fold increase in Cmin. Following a 200 mg ritonavir dose, there was a 3.6-fold increase of indinavir AUC, a 1.8-fold increase in Cmax, and a 24-fold increase in Cmin. In the same study, twice-daily coadministration of indinavir (800 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg) resulted in increases in ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 61%, 72% and 62% respectively; increases following a 200 mg ritonavir dose were 19%, 96% and 4.7-fold for ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively. The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased indinavir AUC by 178%, based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily); ritonavir AUC increased by 72%. Coadministration of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) had no effect on indinavir AUC but increased Cmin by 4-fold (based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three daily); ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of indinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Minimal benefit of ritonavir-mediated pharmacokinetic enhancement is achieved with doses higher than 100 mg twice daily. In cases of co-administration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and indinavir (800 mg twice daily) caution is warranted as the risk of nephrolithiasis may be increased. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Alterations in concentrations of indinavir are noted when reduced doses are coadministered with ritonavir. Coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 15 days) and indinavir (400 mg twice daily for 15 days) with food was studied in 10 subjects. Effects were assessed relative to indinavir alone (800 mg every 8 hours) given under fasting conditions. On day 15, indinavir AUC decreased by 7%, Cmax decreased by 62%, and Cmin increased 4-fold.

                      <span>Concomitant use of indinavir with rosuvastatin is not recommended. No clinical data are available, but coadministration is likely to increase rosuvastatin concentrations.  However, based on data with another boosted PI (lopinavir/ritonavir), a dose modification of rosuvastatin may be required. This is due to competition for uptake with the liver such that PLASMA concentrations of rosuvastatin may be increased but LIVER concentrations decreased, resulting in a decreased lipid lowering effect. Titrate the rosuvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose with careful monitoring. Increase the dose as required, due to the potential impaired lipid response. </span>

Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir with sildenafil substantially increases plasma concentrations of sildenafil and may result in an increase in adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism. Patients should be advised to report promptly any symptoms to their doctors. The results of one published study in HIV-infected men (n=6) indicated that coadministration of indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours chronically) with a single 25 mg dose of sildenafil resulted in an 11% increase in average AUC0-8h of indinavir and a 48% increase in average indinavir peak concentration (Cmax) compared to 800 mg every 8 hours alone. Average sildenafil AUC was increased by 340% following coadministration of sildenafil and indinavir compared to historical data following administration of sildenafil alone. Sildenafil dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48-hour period in patients receiving concomitant indinavir therapy. Use with increased monitoring for adverse events.<br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Steady state pharmacokinetics of sildenafil were determined in a 44 year old male HIV+ patient stable on lopinavir/ritonavir (666/166 mg/day) and indinavir (1200 mg/day) following initiation of sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil was initiated at 25 mg once daily (for 7 days) and doses increased to obtain therapeutic concentrations, first to 25 mg twice daily (for 14 days) and then to 25 mg three times daily. AUC 0-8 h for the once daily, twice daily and three time daily regimens were 590, 518 and 800 ng/ml.h, respectively; corresponding Cmax values were 154, 159 and 183 ng/ml. Sildenafil mean half life in these subjects was 1.9 h compared to 2.6-3.1 h in the HIV+ subject. In order to achieve therapeutic concentrations, this patient had to be treated with a higher dose than the current recommendations of 25mg every 24 h or 48 h. The authors suggest that long term use of ritonavir may have resulted in delayed induction of PXR (and subsequently CYP3A4) in this patient. This would account for the sildenafil dose increase required in contrast to a dose reduction that may be required when CYP3A4 is inhibited by ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sildenafil in a patient treated with human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors. Aschmann YZ, Kummer O, Linka A, et al. Ther Drug Monit, 2008, 30(1): 130-134. </em></p>
<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and a single dose of sildenafil (25 mg) was investigated in six HIV+ individuals. There was a 4.4 fold increase in sildenafil AUC (0&#8211;8h) when compared to dose normalised historical data. The magnitude of this interaction suggests a lower starting dose of 12.5 mg sildenafil may be more appropriate in this clinical setting. Sildenafil increased indinavir AUC by 11% and Cmax by 47.6%. The increases in plasma indinavir levels are not statistically significant and will not be expected to result in an increased risk of nephrolithiasis.<br /><em>Interaction of sildenafil and indinavir when co-administered to HIV-positive patients.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Indinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window. The European SPC warns that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD but this has not been assessed in a clinical study.</span>

Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces.

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate).

The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption.

It penetrates into the CSF within 4 hours of an oral dose to produce therapeutic concentrations, which may be more than half those in the blood. Up to 40% of sulfadiazine in the blood is present as the acetyl derivative. About 50% of a single dose of sulfadiazine given orally is excreted in the urine in 24 hours; 15 to 40% is excreted as the acetyl derivative. The urinary excretion of sulfadiazine and the acetyl derivative is dependent on pH. About 30% is excreted unchanged in both fast and slow acetylators when the urine is acidic whereas about 75% is excreted unchanged by slow acetylators when the urine is alkaline.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased indinavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As indinavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls. When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target. Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP). The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations. However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.

<p>There was no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug when voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) was coadministered with indinavir (800 mg three times daily) or placebo to 8 healthy subjects. Addition of indinavir resulted in a slight decrease in voriconazole Cmax (from 1745 to 1724 ng/ml) and slight increase in AUC (from 8706 to 8770 ng/ml.h). Mean voriconazole plasma concentrations were similar in the two groups, but were generally higher in the placebo group than in the indinavir group on both study days. Addition of voriconazole resulted in a slight decrease in indinavir Cmin (from 99 to 98 ng/ml), and increases in AUC (from 16266 to 18594 ng/ml.h) and Cmax (from 7323 to 8017 ng/ml). <br /><em>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between voriconazole and indinavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>Coadministration of voriconazole with high dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) is contraindicated because ritonavir significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose. Coadministration of voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. The effect of the coadministration of oral voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) and high dose (400 mg) and low dose (100 mg) oral ritonavir was investigated in two separate studies in healthy volunteers. High doses of ritonavir decreased the steady state Cmax and AUC of oral voriconazole by an average of 66% and 82%. Low doses of ritonavir decreased the Cmax and AUC of voriconazole by an average of 24% and 39% respectively. Administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on mean Cmax and AUC of ritonavir in the high dose study, although a minor decrease in steady state Cmax and AUC of ritonavir with an average of 25% and 13% respectively was observed in the low dose ritonavir interaction study. One outlier subject with raised voriconazole levels was identified in each of the ritonavir interaction studies. <br /><em>Vfend Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, October 2008. </em></p>
