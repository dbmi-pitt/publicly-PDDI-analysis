                    <span><p>There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage when lamivudine was combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and abacavir as well as with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine as a once daily regimen. <br /><em>Epivir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2010.</em></p>
<p>Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant interactions between abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. <br />Triple NRTI Therapy:<br />There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage when abacavir was combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine as a once daily regimen. <br /><em>Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2011.</em></p>
<p>Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase, 15 HIV-infected patients were enrolled in a crossover study evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. <br /><em>Ziagen Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics and safety of single doses of abacavir (600 mg), zidovudine (300 mg) and lamivudine (150 mg) were evaluated when given alone or with either or both of the other drugs to 13 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of abacavir with lamivudine (with or without zidovudine) decreased lamivudine AUC by ~15%, decreased Cmax by ~ 35% and delayed Tmax by ~1 h. While these changes are statistically significant, they are not considered to be clinically significant. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir when given alone, or with zidovudine or lamivudine, or with both zidovudine and lamivudine. <br /><em>Single dose pharmacokinetics and safety of abacavir (1592U98), zidovudine, and lamivudine administered alone and in combination in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated in the body, mostly in the liver by the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Much of a dose of adrenaline is excreted as metabolites in urine. The plasma half-life is about 2-3 minutes. However, when given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, local vasoconstriction may delay absorption so that the effects may last longer than the half-life suggests.<br /><em>Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Injection BP 1 in 1000 UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hameln pharmaceuticals ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours. As lamivudine is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. When administered orally, there is little potential for significant interaction.</span>

Conversely basic drugs may exhibit decreased reabsorption resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect.&nbsp; Ascorbic acid is readily oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised to oxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate - 2 - sulphate. Metabolic turnover appears to be greater in females than males. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body and after an intravenous dose, about 40% is excreted in 8 hours, which is increased to about 70% after tissue saturation. The amount of unchanged drug is dose dependent; in women the excretion of ascorbic acid appears to vary with the stage of the menstrual cycle and it is decreased when taking oral contraceptives. Oxalic acid and ascorbate - 2 - sulphate are excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Ascorbic Acid Injection 500mg/5ml UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated March 2009</em></span>

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Atropine is also absorbed by mucous membranes but less readily from the eye and skin, although significant toxicity can sometimes occur through absorption of excessive eye drops. Atropine is metabolised by hepatic oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites, with about 2% undergoing hydrolysis to tropine and tropic acid. About 30% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

                    <span>Benznidazole is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral doses (&gt; 90% bioavailability) and is widely distributed throughout the body. More than 40% of the drug is bound to plasma protein. The peak plasma concentration occurs after 3 to 4 hours and the half-life is about 12 hours. It is metabolised in the liver and more than 70% of the metabolites are excreted by the kidneys; about 30% of a dose is excreted in the faeces.<br /><em>Raaflaub J, Ziegler WH.

<p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolized in the liver predominantly by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to 2,6-pipecoloxylidine (PPX), both mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4. The terminal half-life of bupivacaine in adults is 2.7 hours, and in neonates it is prolonged up to eight hours. The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anaesthetics and their metabolites. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX.

<p>In vitro studies using rat renal brush border membrane vesicles showed that the initial uptake rate of cefixime into an osmotically sensitive vesicular space showed concentration and ternperature dependencies, indicating the presence of a carrier mediated transport mechanism for cefixime. Organic anions such as probenecid and p-aminohippuric acid and anion transport inhibitors such as 4,4'-diisothiocyano-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and furosemide reduced the uptake significantly. These results indicate that cefixime is transported through the renal brush-border membrane via a carrier-mediated transport system which is common to organic anions. <br /><em>Carrier-mediated transport of cefixime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, via an organic anion transport system in the rat renal brush-border membrane.

Approximately 80 to 90% of the dose is recovered in the urine within 24 hours. Less than 1% is excreted via the bile, significantly limiting the amount entering the bowel.<br /><em>Fortum&#174; 500 injection (ceftazidime) Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2009</em></p>
<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>In a study of 2 healthy subjects, ceftazidime was administered by i.v. infusion and 1 g probenecid was administered orally after steady state plasma concentrations were reached. In a second session, ceftazidime was administered at increasing infusion rates such that three different levels of plasma drug concentration were achieved. The renal clearance of ceftazidime was calculated based upon unbound plasma concentration, and tubular clearance was estimated by subtracting inulin clearance from the renal clearance of the antibiotic. Non-linear regression analysis was used to estimate parameters describing the saturability of tubular excretion and the effect of probenecid inhibition. Tubular excretion of ceftazidime was practically zero, and there was no significant inhibition of renal clearance when administered with probenecid.<br /><em>The renal clearance of cefuroxime and ceftazidime and the effect of probenecid on their tubular excretion.

The elimination of ceftriaxone is not altered by co-administration with probenecid.<br /><em>Rocephin&#174; (ceftriaxone sodium) for injection, US Prescribing Information, Genentech USA, Inc, updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>An in vitro study investigated the interaction of human-OAT2 and rat-OAT2 renal organic anion transporters with cephalosporin antibiotics using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human-OAT2 and rat-OAT2 . Human-OAT2 is localized to the basolateral side of the proximal tubule, whereas rat-OAT2 is localized to the apical side of the proximal tubule. Ceftriaxone dose-dependently inhibited organic anion uptake mediated by human-OAT2 and rat-OAT2. There was no species difference observed for the effects of OAT2 with cephalosporins between human and rat transporters. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibitory effects for human-OAT2 were competitive. In conclusion, human-OAT2 interacts with cephalosporins, and thus, human-OAT2 may mediate the uptake of cephalosporins on the basolateral side of the proximal tubule. <br /><em>Interaction of human and rat organic anion transporter 2 with various cephalosporin antibiotics.

<p>The kinetics and binding parameters of ceftriaxone were studied in eight healthy subjects who received, in sequence, 1.0 g ceftriaxone and 1.0 g ceftriaxone together with 250 and 500 mg probenecid. Probenecid increased the total systemic clearance (CLTS) from 0.244 to 0.312 ml/min/kg, whereas the terminal half-life (t1/2T (beta)) fell from 8.1 to 6.5 h. In contrast, the renal clearance of free ceftriaxone (CLFR) was decreased from 2.09 to 1.67 ml/min/kg, confirming a small but significant contribution of tubular secretion to the renal elimination of ceftriaxone. <br /><em>Effect of probenecid on the elimination and protein binding of ceftriaxone.

                    <span>The primary UGT enzymes responsible for chloramphenicol O-glucuronidation were evaluated in vitro. Reaction phenotyping for the glucuronidation of chloramphenicol with 12 expressed human liver UGT isoforms has identified UGT2B7 as having the highest activity for 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9. The formation of 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronide by pooled HLM and expressed UGT2B7 exhibited substrate inhibition kinetics with apparent K(m) values of 408.2 and 115.0 microM, respectively. Azidothymidine (AZT) and hyodeoxycholic acid (substrates of UGT2B7) inhibited 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation in pooled HLMs. In 10 donor HLM preparations, both chloramphenicol 3-O- and chloramphenicol 1-O-glucuronidation showed a significant correlation with AZT glucuronidation (UGT2B7) at 30 microM chloramphenicol.

<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

                    <span><p>Daunorubicin hydrochloride is mainly metabolized in the liver; each accompanying medication influencing liver function may also influence the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin hydrochloride and as a consequence influence efficacy and/or toxicity. Daunorubicin is rapidly taken up by tissues, especially by the kidneys, spleen, liver and heart. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, subsequent release of drug and its metabolites from the tissues is slow (t&#189; = 55 hours). Daunorubicin is rapidly metabolised in the liver. The major metabolite daunorubicinol is also active. Daunorubicin is excreted slowly in the urine, mainly as metabolites with 25% excreted in the first 5 days. Biliary excretion also makes a significant (40%) contribution to elimination. <br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></p>
<div>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em>

<div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, or zidovudine). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In the gut, diloxanide furoate is largely, if not wholly, hydrolysed into diloxanide and furoic acid under the combined action of bacterial and gut esterases. After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

                    <span>Orally administered dopamine is rapidly metabolised in the G.I. tract. Following IV administration, the onset of action of dopamine occurs within 5 minutes, and the drug has a duration of action of less than 10 minutes. Dopamine is metabolised in the liver, kidneys, and plasma by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals. Dopamine is excreted in urine principally as HVA and its sulphate and glucuroide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small fraction of a dose is excreted unchanged. <br /><em>Dopamine 40 mg/ml Sterile Concentrate UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hospira UK Ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

<p>The pharmacokinetics as well as erythrocyte and plasma protein binding of doxycycline were studied in fifteen patients with various renal function impairments after oral doxycycline polyphosphate single administration. Plasma half-life (t 1/2), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), urinary excretion, renal clearance, erythrocyte and plasma protein binding (%) were regressed vs creatinine clearance. No significant correlations were observed between t 1/2 or AUC and renal function nor plasma protein binding and plasma albumin concentrations. Significant correlations were obtained between urinary excretion, renal clearance, erythrocyte binding, plasma protein binding and creatinine clearance. Constancy of overall elimination parameters in renal failure is due to parallel increase in plasma free fraction of doxycycline.<br /><em>The effects of chronic renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline in man.

<div>Eflornithine was administered to six healthy men in single intravenous doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and oral doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 hr after oral doses. The decay of the plasma concentrations followed first-order kinetics with a mean half-life (t 1/2) for all four doses studied of 199 +/- 6 min (+/- SD). Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight. The amount of unchanged drug in 24-hr urine samples was 47 +/- 7% and 40 +/- 11% after 10 and 20 mg/kg orally, and 78% and 81 +/- 8% after 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Twenty-four-hour urinary recovery of unchanged drug was 46.9% of the 10mg/kg and 40.3% of the 20 mg/kg oral doses. &gt;86% of the oral doses were cleared from the body by renal filtration. In the case of intravenous dosing, 81% of the drug was eliminated by the kidneys. <br /><em>Kinetics of alpha-difluoromethylornithine: an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Ephedrine is predominantly excreted unchanged via renal pathways. There are no clear data to suggest whether elimination of ephedrine occurs via active renal transport or glomerular filtration, therefore competition for active renal elimination pathways with lamivudine can not be ruled out. As levels of either drug may potentially be increased, monitoring for adverse events and renal function may be warranted. </span>

                    <span><p>Ephedrine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and extensively distributed throughout the body with accumulation in the liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen and brain. The plasma half-life is reported to be between 3-11 hours, with up to 95% being excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Ephedrine Hydrochloride Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Wockhardt UK Ltd, updated November 2008</em></p>
<p>A pharmacokinetic model was developed based on the simultaneous modelling using plasma samples gathered from two clinical trials. Treatments consisted of single-doses of pharmaceutical caffeine and ephedrine, given alone or together, and an herbal formulation containing both caffeine and ephedrine. A mixed-effect statistical model and the program NONMEM was used to take account of intersubject variability. Three hundred and seventy-nine ephedrine, 352 norephedrine, 417 caffeine plasma concentrations and 40 ephedrine urine concentrations were obtained from 24 subjects. Ephedrine is mostly excreted unchanged in the urine, but is also metabolized to norephedrine to a small and variable extent, involving enzymatic N-demethylation and oxidative deaminiation of the side chain. The variance in Km was relatively large, indicating substantial variation in the extent of metabolism of ephedrine to norephedrine. This pathway, however, is minor compared with the renal elimination of ephedrine and, even after repeated drug intake, significant drug accumulation would not be expected. Although a saturable metabolism of ephedrine to norephedrine was observed, this was thought to represent a minor path of ephedrine elimination.<br /><em>Mechanistic pharmacokinetic modelling of ephedrine, norephedrine and caffeine in healthy subjects.

<p>The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system <br /><em>Epivir&#174; (lamivudine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd.

<p>The disposition and metabolic fate of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T) were evaluated both in isolated hepatocytes and in nonhuman primates. Rapid formation of thymine and beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) occurred following incubation of hepatocytes with 10 microM [5(-3)H]D4T. Substantial levels of tritiated water were also detected. Exposure of cells to D4T in the presence of either 1 mM thymine or 10 microM benzyloxybenzyluracil, an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, decreased intracellular BAIBA levels by approximately 89 and 63%, respectively. Concurrently, [3H]thymine levels increased two- to fivefold. These results are consistent with D4T being cleaved to thymine, which is then degraded to BAIBA. A similar metabolic disposition was observed in monkeys following administration of 25 mg of [5(-3)H]D4T per kg of body weight. Approximately 50% of the administered dose was recovered in urine within 24 h, with the majority of the radioactivity representing unchanged drug. <br /><em>Cretton EM, Zhou Z, Kidd LB, In vitro and in vivo disposition and metabolism of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine.

<p>Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration.&nbsp; After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches, but does not equal, the daily dose administered.&nbsp; As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys.&nbsp; Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine of some patients weeks after drug administration was discontinued.&nbsp; Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <span>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span><div>When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I. Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

No further cilastatin appeared in the urine thereafter. Approximately 10% was found as the N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase comparable to that of cilastatin. Activity of dehydropeptidase-I in the kidney returned to normal levels shortly after the elimination of cilastatin from the blood stream.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Since it is hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase-I, a zinc metallo-enzyme resident in the brush border of the renal tubule, imipenem is co-administered with cilastatin, a reversible inhibitor of this enzyme. This provides clinically relevant concentrations of imipenem in the urine for 8-10 h after a 500 mg dose. Renal clearance of unchanged imipenem accounts for 60-70% of plasma clearance when the imipenem is given with cilastatin. Administration of radiolabelled drugs results in recovery of over 99% of the radiolabel in the urine for both imipenem and cilastatin. With increasing renal dysfunction, the half-life of imipenem is controlled by a metabolic clearance pathway which is unaffected by cilastatin. Renal clearance is by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion for both imipenem and cilastatin. <br /><em>An overview of the pharmacology of imipenem/cilastatin. Drusano GL.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>The bioavailabilities of a conventional and two slow release 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) formulations were compared after oral administration in a three way cross-over study in 8 male volunteers. In a further group of 6 male volunteers the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ISDN were investigated after intravenous infusion of a median dose of 14.1 mg for 2.5 h. The median elimination half-lives of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and IS-5-MN-2-Glu were 0.7, 5.1, 3.2 and 2.5 h, respectively. Apart from IS-5-MN-2-Glu, with a renal clearance of 5.9 l/min which suggested substantial glucuronidation in the kidney, the renal clearances of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and the corresponding amounts excreted were negligible. 27.8% of the administered ISDN was excreted as IS-5-MN-2-Glu (8.7%) and IS (19.1%). Calculations based on the two mononitrate metabolites formed from ISDN showed an incomplete recovery of 84.1%, leading to the assumption that a simultaneous denitration to IS must have occurred. <br /><em>Abshagen U, Betzien G, Endele R et al.

                    <span>Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver, and ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively in the feces over an estimated 12 days, with less than 1% of the administered dose excreted in the urine.<br />In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes have shown that ivermectin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em> </span>

                    <span>Mannitol is metabolized only very slightly, if at all, to glycogen in the liver. The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

A daily dose of 25 mg/kg (1 g/day) of meglumine antimoniate was administered intravenously for 28 consecutive days. The pharmacokinetics of the drug in plasma and urine were performed on the 5th day of treatment. The total amount of antimony given just before the 24-h collection period was 350 mg and the total amount detected in the urine was 238mg. Residual plasma levels which were assessed on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th days of treatment were 9.8, 7.5, 7.5, 7.4 and 6.5 mg/l respectively. The half-life was 15 h as compared with 2.02 + 0.25 h in patients with normal renal function. The clearance of antimony was close to the glomerular filtration rate as assessed by inulin clearance, suggesting that no other endogenous clearance takes place in patient with renal insufficiency. The patient tolerated a full course of meglumine antimoniate in spite of a marked reduced renal clearance.<br /><em>Tolerance and pharmacokinetics of antimony in a patient with renal failure.

When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol.

<p>This study enrolled 28 CNS-involved patients with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense at the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute (Alupe, Kenya) to examine treatment efficacy and toxicity of melarsoprol in relation to renal excretion/dose relationships. This study complied with World Health Organization treatment recommendations, initially treating with suramin followed by three courses of melarsoprol. Traced study patients had a relapse rate of 4.1%. The toxicity and crude death rate was 7.1%. Total urine arsenic output was measured between 24 and 48 hr after the last dose for each course. The range of means of total urine arsenic output between the three treatment courses was 356-511 micrograms. There was no correlation comparing melarsoprol dose, estimated creatine clearance, or urine arsenic output. Urinary pharmacokinetic parameters are not predictive of toxicity or therapeutic efficacy.<br /><em>Attempt to correlate urine arsenic excretion with clinical course during melarsoprol therapy of patients with Rhodesian trypanosomiasis.

Delayed excretion and accumulation of this metabolite occur in patients with renal insufficiency and may cause an increased hypotensive effect during methyldopa therapy.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

                    <span><p>In vitro studies have shown that interactions between miltefosine and drugs which are metabolised by cytochrome P450, glucuronidated or otherwise conjugated are unlikely, however the possibility of interactions with commonly used drugs can not be totally excluded. No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em></p>
<p>A case report describes the first two patients to be treated with miltefosine for post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). One was a 26-year-old Ethiopian man who had been treated with sodium stibogluconate, for relapsing visceral leishmaniasis (VL), four times between August 2002 and March 2004. In January 2004 this patient was found to be seropositive for HIV and began antiretroviral treatment with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. Five months later he developed clinical PKDL, with extensive cutaneous, conjunctival and oral mucosal involvement. The second patient was a 42-year-old Ethiopian man who was treated for relapsing VL in November 2003. He too was subsequently found to be seropositive for HIV and was treated with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine from May 2004. He developed a nodular rash of PKDL over his face and upper body 2 weeks after starting the antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of both patients with oral miltefosine, at 100 mg/day for 28 days, led to the complete regression of their PKDL lesions. When checked 3-6 months after the end of the miltesofine treatment, neither patient showed any signs of VL, PKDL or other HIV-associated disease. Significant adverse events were not observed.<br /><em>Successful miltefosine treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis occurring during antiretroviral therapy.

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) were determined using non-linear mixed effects modelling on samples from HIV-infected subjects receiving lamivudine alone (n=47) or with nevirapine (200 mg twice daily, n=43). The results of the modelling analysis revealed that nevirapine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                    <span><p>Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial.<br /><em>Macrodantin&#174; Capsules US Prescribing Information, Norwich Pharmaceuticals Inc, revised January 2009</em></p>
<p>Nitrofurantoin is metabolised in the liver and most body tissues while about 30 to 40% of a dose is excreted rapidly in the urine as unchanged nitrofurantoin. Some tubular reabsorption may occur in acid urine. Average doses give a concentration of 50 to 200 micrograms/mL in the urine in patients with normal renal function.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press, (via medicines Complete), last reviewed 20/8/2010</em> </p>
<p>Nitrofurantoin 50mg was administered in a three-way random crossover design to six healthy men. After a 45-mM intravenous infusion the plasma concentration data could be described by a two-compartment open-body model with a terminal halflife of 58.1 &#177; 15 min. Although absorption appeared to be complete, the absorption rate profile was complex and erratic. Two subjects failed to achieve the minimum effective urine concentration of 32 microgramslml. After the intravenous infusion 47 % of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine and 1.2 % was recovered as the reduced metabolite aminofurantoin. After oral administration, 34% was excreted unchanged in urine.<br /><em>Nitrofurantoin disposition. Hoener B, Patterson SE. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1981 Jun;29(6):808-16.</em></p></span>

<p>Multiple doses of lamivudine and a single dose of interferon were coadministered to 19 healthy male subjects in a pharmacokinetics study. Results indicated a small (10%) reduction in lamivudine AUC, but no change in interferon pharmacokinetic parameters when the drugs were given in combination. All other pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2) were unchanged. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and interferon alfa in this study.<br /><em>Epivir-HBV US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, October 2007.<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />Results from pharmacokinetic substudies of pivotal phase III trials demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interaction of lamivudine on Pegasys in HBV patients or between Pegasys and ribavirin in HCV patients.<br /><em>Pegasys Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2010.</em><br />&nbsp;<br />Patients receiving PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a)/COPEGUS (ribavirin) and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a), COPEGUS (ribavirin) or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.<br /><em>Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.</em></p>
<p>Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment- associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh &gt;6).<br /><em>Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.</em></p>
<p>Cirrhotic&nbsp; chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients&#8217; clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score &#8805;6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. Dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS, COPEGUS or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.<br /><em>Pegasys US Prescribing Information, Genentech Inc, June 2010.</em></p>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Up to 80% of a dose is excreted via the kidneys, predominantly as metabolites and rarely as unchanged drug. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions with lamivudine via competition for active renal elimination pathways. </span>

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is not extensively metabolised in man. The drug is rapidly excreted in urine; however traces remain in the plasma after a single dose for up to 48 hours due to extensive protein binding. Penicillamine is eliminated primarily by metabolism to the disulphide which is excreted in the urine together with a small proportion of unchanged drug. Some of the dose is excreted as a penicillamine copper complex and some as the S-methyl derivative.<br /><em>Penicillamine 250mg Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Kent Pharmaceuticals Ltd, updated April 2012</em></p>
<p>About 80% of the absorbed dose is excreted rapidly in the urine, mostly as mixed disulphides. Some of the dose is excreted as a penicillamine copper complex and some as the S-methyl derivative.<br /><em>Distamine&#174; (Penicillamine) 250mg Film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Alliance Pharmaceuticals, updated June 2010</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin may decrease plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Conversely, enzyme inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and ketoconazole may increase plasma concentrations of praziquantel.

                    <span><div>To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

                    <span><p>In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic(e.g. plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in 18 HIV/HCV co-infected patients as part of a multi-drug regimen, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh &gt;6). <br /><em>Epivir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011. </em></p>
<p>The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine. <br /><em>Effect of ribavirin on intracellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection: final results of a randomized clinical study.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate). Rees PH, Keating MI, Kager PA, Hockmeyer WT. Lancet. 1980 Aug 2;2(8188):226-9</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

<p>A case report decribes a patient with newly-diagnosed HIV infection and biopsy-proven cerebral toxoplasmosis treated with sulphadiazine 2 g six-hourly with pyrimethamine 50 mg once daily. Despite adequate hydration and daily examination of urine for sulphadiazine crystals, renal function deteriorated suddenly after 13 days of sulphadiazine therapy. Obstructive uropathy due to bilateral ureteric stones with hydronephrosis occurred, resulting in rapid onset renal failure. Sulphadiazine was discontinued and clindamycin was substituted. With intravenous fluid hydration and bilateral nephrostomies the urolithiasis resolved. Sulphadiazine and its hepatic metabolite acetylsulphadiazine are excreted via the renal tract; they are poorly soluble in urine and may potentially precipitate in the acid environment, producing crystalluria and stones. Crystalluria is common, may occur in up to 28% of patients taking sulphadiazine, and is potentially nephrotoxic via both direct chemical irritation of the tubular epithelium and tubular obstruction due to urolithiasis.&nbsp; The authors suggest that if outpatient treatment of toxoplasmosis is contemplated, careful attention to fluid balance, daily checking of urine for the presence of crystalluria, and frequent monitoring of biochemical renal function (3 times a week) are required in order to avoid this potentially serious complication of treatment.<br /><em>Sulphadiazine-induced obstructive renal failure complicating treatment of HIV-associated toxoplasmosis.

These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.</span>

The rate of timolol metabolism varies between individuals. Poor metabolisers (approximately 10%) show higher plasma levels and slower elimination of timolol than extensive metabolisers. Within individuals, however, plasma concentrations and half-life are reproducible. As the therapeutic response and some adverse effects are related to plasma concentrations of timolol, poor metabolisers may require lower than normal doses. <br /><em>Betim&#174; (Timolol) 10mg Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Meda Pharmaceuticals,updated October 2011</em></p>

                    <span>In vivo, triclabendazole is rapidly oxidised into its sulfoxide metabolite, which is further oxidised to the sulfone metabolite. The sulfoxide form is predominant in plasma, with the parent compound and the sulfone metabolite having AUCs respectively of approximately 1% and 10% of that of the sulfoxide. The rapid biotransformation of triclabendazole in man and the previous findings in animals produced evidence of presystemic biotransformation including first-pass metabolism of triclabendazole. In animals, the drug is largely excreted via the biliary tract in the faeces (90%), together with the sulfoxide and subsequently the sulfone metabolite. Less than 10% of an oral dose is excreted in the urine.<br /><em>Egaten&#174; Summary of product Charateristics, Novartis Pharma AG Basel, Switzerland, Produced July 2000</em></span>

                    <span><p>Administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg results in a 40% increase in lamivudine exposure, because of the trimethoprim component; the sulfamethoxazole component did not interact. However, unless the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of lamivudine is necessary. Lamivudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole. When concomitant administration is warranted, patients should be monitored clinically. Co-administration of lamivudine with high doses of co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis should be avoided. <br /><em>Epivir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2010.</em></p>
<p>Lamivudine and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) were coadministered to 14 HIV-positive patients in a single-centre, open-label, randomized, crossover study. Each patient received treatment with a single 300 mg dose of lamivudine and TMP/SMX 160/800 mg once a day for 5 days with concomitant administration of lamivudine 300 mg with the fifth dose in a crossover design. Coadministration of TMP/SMX with lamivudine resulted in an increase of 43&#177;23% (mean &#177; SD) in lamivudine AUC, a decrease of 29&#177;13% in lamivudine oral clearance, and a decrease of 30&#177;36% in lamivudine renal clearance. The pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by coadministration with lamivudine. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP.<br /><em>Epivir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011. </em></p>
<p>Non-linear mixed effects modelling analysis on samples from 77 HIV-infected subjects receiving lamivudine alone (150 twice daily) or with nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) with concurrent trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg every other day [n=51], three times weekly [n=23], or twice daily [n=3]) revealed an effect of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole on lamivudine pharmacokinetics. There was a significant reduction of 31% in apparent oral clearance of lamivudine which would be expected to result in a 43% increase in the average steady-state concentration. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and lamivudine in patients with HIV-1 infection. Sabo JP et al. AAPS Pharm Sci, 2002, 2: E1. </em></p>
<p>The effect of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg once daily) on a single dose of lamivudine (300 mg) was studied in 14 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration increased lamivudine AUV by 43% and decreased renal clearance by 35%. There was no effect of lamivudine on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim of sulfamethoxazole. Given the favourable safety profile of lamivudine, it is unlikely that this interaction will result in a significant increase in concentration-related toxicity at the doses studied. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of lamivudine administered alone and with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

                    <span><p>Vancomycin is metabolized only to a low extent. After parenteral administration it is excreted almost completely as microbiologically active substance (approx. 75-90% within 24 hours) through glomerular filtration via the kidneys. Biliary excretion is insignificant (less than 5% of a dose). The clearance of vancomycin from plasma correlates nearly with the glomerular filtration rate. No vancomycin metabolites have been identified so far in humans<br /><em>Vancomycin, 500 mg, powder for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Limited, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p>In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/hr, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/hr. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg.

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Co-administration of zidovudine results in a 13% increase in zidovudine exposure (AUC) and a 28% increase in peak plasma levels. This is not considered to be of significance to patient safety and therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary. Zidovudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine.The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system. Zidovudine is not eliminated by this mechanism and are unlikely to interact with lamivudine. <br /><em>Epivir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2010.</em></p>
<p>No clinically significant alterations in lamivudine or zidovudine pharmacokinetics were observed in 12 asymptomatic HIV-infected adult patients given a single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) in combination with multiple doses of lamivudine (300 mg twice daily). <br /><em>Epivir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011. </em></p>
<p>A modest increase in Cmax (28%) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine, however overall exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered. Zidovudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine. <br /><em>Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of a single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) and lamivudine (300 mg every 12 hours) increased zidovudine AUC by 13% and had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine. Routine dose modification of zidovudine is not warranted. <br /><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011.</em></p></span>
