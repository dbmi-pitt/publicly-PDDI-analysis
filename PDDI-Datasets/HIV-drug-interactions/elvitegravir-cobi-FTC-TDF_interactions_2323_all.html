Separating the doses by 2 hours decreased elvitegravir exposure by 10-20%, whereas separating the doses by 4 hours did not affect elvitegravir exposure.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours. No interaction is expected with elvitegravir/cobicistat as it does not inhibit the renal transporters OATs and OCTs. However, as emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. When administered orally, there is little potential for significant interaction.</span>

(e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy.

A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclomethasone).

If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.<br /><em>Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.<br /><em>Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.</em><br /></div></span>

No dose adjustment is needed when Stribild is combined with H2 receptor antagonists. Administration of famotidine 12 h apart from elvitegravir/cobicistat had no effect on the AUC and Cmax of elvitegravir or cobicistat. In vitro data indicate that cimetidine inhibits OAT1 and OCT2 at concentrations much higher than the observed clinical concentrations, therefore no effect is expected on tenofovir-DF or emtricitabine. However, tenofovir-DF (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as cimetidine could potentially increase the absorption of tenofovir-DF, thereby increasing the systemic concentration of tenofovir. Monitoring of tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including frequent renal monitoring, is recommended.</span>

In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. As an inhibitor of CYP3A, cobicistat is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a pharmacokinetic modelling study. Note: colecalciferol can be found in multivitamins preparations which may also contain minerals. As the effect of cationic complexation cannot be excluded, it is recommended to separate the administration of elvitegravir/cobicistat and multivitamin preparations by at least 4 hours.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by two pathways. Activation (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is catalyzed by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. In theory, elvitegravir/cobicistat could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway which may increase the efficacy and the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Careful monitoring of cyclophosphamide related side effects is recommended. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF do not interfere with this metabolic pathway.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Dacarbazine undergoes activation to MTIC primarily via CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP2E1, with CYP1A1 having a role in extrahepatic metabolism. In vitro data indicate that dacarbazine is a substrate of the renal transporter OAT1. Elvitegravir/cobicistat does not inhibit or induce the cytochromes involved in the metabolic activation of dacarbazine. Emtricitabine is unlikely to compete for active renal transport as emtricitabine is eliminated by different renal transporters. However, tenofovir-DF can potentially compete with dacarbazine for renal elimination via OAT1. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended but renal function and haematological parameters should be monitored.</span>

<div>Stribild is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, Stribild should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Stribild should not be used in conjunction with protease inhibitors inhibitors due to potential drug-drug interactions including altered and/or suboptimal pharmacokinetics of cobicistat, elvitegravir, and/or the coadministered antiretroviral products.

<div>The pharmacokinetics of darunavir (600 mg twice daily) was determined following the administration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or cobicistat (150 mg twice daily). Exposures of darunavir with cobicistat were equivalent to exposures of darunavir with ritonavir (1% increase in AUC and Cmax and 5% decrease in Cmin). Adding elvitegravir (150 mg once daily) or etravirine (200 mg twice daily) to darunavir/cobicistat had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, darunavir and etravirine. The AUC of elvitegravir in presence of darunavir was modestly decreased. </div>

<p>&nbsp;<br>The pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety of Genvoya and darunavir (800 mg once daily) versus a darunavir-based multi-tablet regimen was evaluated in treatment-experienced (2 and 3 class-drug regimen resistance), virologically suppressed, HIV-infected adults in a 48-week, multi-centre, randomized, open label study (GS-US-292-0119). Elvitegravir Ctrough was &gt;10-fold above the elvitegravir protein binding-adjusted IC95 (45 ng/ml) and darunavir Ctrough was &gt;22-fold above the darunavir protein binding-adjusted IC50 (55 ng/ml). The patients remained virologically suppressed and did not develop resistance in the Genvoya arm over 48 weeks of therapy. In addition, no subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events. A switch to Genvoya and darunavir resulted in improvement in quantitative proteinuria compared with darunavir-containing regimens. The authors conclude that for treatment experienced individuals with &gt;2 class resistance on complex high-pill burden regimens, switching to Genvoya and darunavir may provide a simple once-daily, two-pill option with superior efficacy and comparable tolerability.<br><em>Strategic simplification: the efficacy and safety of switching to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) plus darunavir (DRV) in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults (NCT01968551).

However diclofenac could potentially decrease renal elimination of tenofovir-DF as in vitro data suggest that diclofenac inhibits the renal transporters OAT1 and MRP4 (strong inhibition) which are involved in tenofovir-DF excretion. [Note: coadministration of NSAIDs and tenofovir-DF may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity in particular if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If tenofovir-DF is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.]</span>

                    <span><div>Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.<br /><em>Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.<br /><em>Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.</em><br /><br /></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter elvitegravir/cobicistat exposure. Significant interactions are not expected with emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF.</span>

The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as elvitegravir can reduce empagliflozin exposure due to UGT induction but cobicistat may increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required.

Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended. Emtricitabine and tenofovir DF do not interact with this metabolic pathway. However, tenofovir-DF (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as felodipine could potentially increase the absorption of tenofovir-DF, thereby increasing the systemic concentration of tenofovir.

Note, the European SPC suggests that fluconazole concentrations may be increased with cobicistat and recommends clinical monitoring.

In vitro data indicate that furosemide is an inhibitor of the renal transporters OAT1/OAT3 and therefore could potentially decrease tenofovir-DF renal elimination.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin but elvitegravir/cobicistat is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). Elvitegravir/cobicistat is unlikely to induce UGT2B7 and is unlikely to alter morphine concentrations. However, elvitegravir/cobicistat does inhibit P-gp and could potentially increase the amount of morphine entering the CNS and may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS. Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF do not interact with heroin metabolism.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Ibuprofen is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8 and direct glucuronidation. In vitro data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9, but a dose adjustment is unlikely to be required for ibuprofen when coadministered with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However, ibuprofen could potentially decrease renal elimination of tenofovir-DF as in vitro data suggest that ibuprofen inhibits the renal transporters OAT1 (moderate inhibition) and MRP4 which are involved in tenofovir-DF excretion. No a priori dose adjustment is recommended. [Note: coadministration of NSAIDs and tenofovir-DF may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity in particular if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If tenofovir-DF is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.]</span>

                    <span><div>Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with risk factors for renal dysfunction. If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.<br /><em>Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.<br /><em>Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.</em><br /></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Levonorgestrel is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is glucuronidated to a minor extent. An analysis of 570 HIV-infected women in Swaziland using levonorgestrel implant and lopinavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or efavirenz based regimens suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of levonorgestrel implant. Similarly, elvitegravir/cobicistat could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception. Coadministration of Stribild with oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied and therefore should be avoided. Alternative (non hormonal) methods of contraception should be considered. The European SPC states a hormonal contraceptive should contain at least 30 µg ethinylestradiol and norgestimate as the progestogen.</span>

Elvitegravir/cobicistat could potentially increase macitentan exposure. Of note, since macitentan is not a substrate of OATPs, the magnitude of the interaction is expected to be lower than that observed with bosentan. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended, but caution should be exercised when macitentan is administered concomitantly with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Mefenamic acid is metabolized by CYP2C9 and additionally glucuronidated by UGT2B7 and UGT1A9. In vitro data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9, but a dose adjustment is unlikely to be required for mefenamic acid when coadministered with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However, mefenamic acid could potentially decrease the renal elimination of tenofovir-DF as in vitro data suggest that mefenamic acid inhibits the renal transporter OAT1. [Note: coadministration of NSAIDs and tenofovir-DF may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity in particular if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If tenofovir-DF is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.]</span>

If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.<br /><em>Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.<em><br />Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.</em></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Mesna is rapidly oxidised to its only metabolite, mesna disulphide via the physiological cysteine system. Approximately 32% and 33% of an administered dose is eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and mesna disulphide respectively. Co-admnistration with other drugs which are predominantly eliminated by active renal transport may lead to competition for renal transporters and may raise exposure to either drug. Administration of prebenecid, a renal organic anion transporter inhibitor, to healthy subjects significantly increased combined mesna and dimesna plasma exposure, while decreasing the renal clearance. This may decrease the efficacy of mesna as a chemoprotectant, increasing the risk of ifosfamide-and cisplatin-induced toxicities. </span>

Methotrexate is predominantly eliminated via the kidneys, including active tubular secretion (OAT1, OAT3 mediate methotrexate transport in the kidney whereas MRP4 and BCRP mediate methotrexate efflux in the urine). A clinically significant interaction with elvitegravir, cobicistat or emtricitabine is unlikely. In theory, there is potential for competition for active renal transport mechanisms if tenofovir-DF and methotrexate are coadministered. However, the results of a clinical study evaluating the co-administration of high-dose of intravenous methotrexate with different NRTI, including tenofovir, showed that methotrexate half-life was not prolonged. &nbsp;However, since methotrexate and tenofovir may both cause tubular toxicity, the use of tenofovir-DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.

The main metabolic pathway of miltefosine appears to be mediated by phospholipases.

No dose adjustment is recommended when mirabegron is combined with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp such as cobicistat in patients with normal hepatic or renal function. However, a dose decrease of mirabegron to 25 mg once daily in patients is recommended for patients who have mildly impaired hepatic or renal function and who are taking a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Naproxen is mainly glucuronidated by UGT2B7 (major) and demethylated to desmethylnaproxen by CYP2C9 (major) and CYP1A2. In vivo data indicate that elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9, but a dose adjustment is unlikely to be required for naproxen when coadministered with elvitegravir/cobicistat. However, coadministration could potentially decrease renal eliminationof tenofovir-DF. Naproxen and its metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidney. In vitro data suggest that naproxen inhibits the renal transporters OAT1 and OAT3 which are involved in tenofovir-DF excretion. No a priori dose adjustment is recommended, but renal function should be monitored. [Note: coadministration of NSAIDs and tenofovir-DF may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity in particular if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. If tenofovir-DF is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.]</span>

If Stribild is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.<br /><em>Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.<br /><em>Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.</em></div></span>

(e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Although metabolism of penicillamine is not fully elucidated, multiple mechanisms and sites of metabolism are thought to be involved. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways. However, penicillamine has nephrotoxic potential and use of tenofovir-DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.

(e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of Stribild are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of Stribild with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include high-dose or multiple NSAIDs. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.<br /><em>Stribild Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2015.</em><br /></div></span>

Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent 3A4. Since proguanil is a prodrug, there is concern that inhibition of metabolism by elvitegravir/cobicistat will reduce the pharmacological effect. However, synergy with atovaquone is related to proguanil, not cycloguanil. When the drugs are coadministered, CYP inhibition could potentially enhance this synergistic effect which may offset decreased cycloguanil formation. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF do not interact with this metabolic pathway. </span>

Rifabutin exposure was similar to values obtained alone, but 25-O-desacetylrifabutin exposures were 4.8 to 6.3 fold higher. The European SPC recommends that if the combination is needed, to use rifabutin 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (e.g. Monday-Wednesday-Friday) with increased monitoring for rifabutin associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis due to increased desacetyl rifabutin exposure. Further dose reduction of rifabutin has not been studied and a twice weekly dose of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.</span>

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Sacubitril is rapidly converted to LBQ657 (active metabolite) by carboxylesterases and the active metabolite is not further metabolized to a significant extent. Sacubitril inhibits OATP1B1 and LBQ657 is a substrate of OATP1B1/3, OAT1 and OAT3. Elvitegravir and emtricitabine do not interfere with LBQ657 elimination. Cobicistat was shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 in vitro but is unlikely to inhibit OATP1B1 in the range of concentrations obtained when used as a pharmacokinetic booster. However, tenofovir is eliminated via OAT1 and therefore could potentially compete with LBQ657 renal elimination (clinical relevance is unclear). Start with the lowest recommended dose of sacubitril and titrate dosage as tolerated by the patient.</p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Elvitegravir/cobicistat could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window. The European SPC for sitagliptin warns that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD but this has not been assessed in clinical study. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF are unlikely to interfere with the renal transporters involved in sitagliptin’s active secretion.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the anount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6>2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. Emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF do not interact with this pathway.</span>

Following coadministration, tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 6%, 3% and 8%, respectively, whereas emtricitabine AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 5%, 3% and 8%, respectively. Elvitegravir AUC and Cmax decreased by 16% and 21%, respectively, but were within the no-effect boundary. Elvitegravir Cmin, the parameter best associated with antiviral activity, increased by 32% and was &gt;10-fold above the protein-binding adjusted IC95 (45 ng/mL). The AUC of cobicistat increased by 2% but Cmax decreased by 13% and Cmin increased by 3.4-fold. The authors describe these changes as not clinically meaningful and no dose adjustment is necessary when Stribild is coadministered with telaprevir.</div><div><em>Lack of clinically relevant drug interactions between elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and telaprevir.

Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is little potential for elvitegravir/cobicistat to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range.

Hepatic elimination involves mainly a non enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as a glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Elvitegravir/cobicistat coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan related side effects.

                      <span>Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers which are metabolised by different cytochromes. R-warfarin is primarily metabolised by CYP1A2 and 3A4. S-warfarin (more potent) is metabolised by CYP2C9. The net effect is difficult to predict as elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and cobicistat is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. A case report of coadministration of warfarin with Stribild (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir-DF) described decreased warfarin exposure which required a 60% increase in warfarin dose, suggesting that CYP2C9 induction by elvitegravir has a stronger effect on warfarin metabolism than CYP3A inhibition by cobicistat.
