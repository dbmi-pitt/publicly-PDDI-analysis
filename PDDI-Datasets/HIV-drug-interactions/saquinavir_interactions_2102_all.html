<p>ACTG 359 was a controlled study of SQV (soft gel) in combination with ritonavir (RTV) or nelfinavir (NFV) together with delavirdine (DLV), adefovir (ADV), or both. SQV was dosed at 400 mg q12h with 400 mg RTV or 800 mg q8h with 750 mg NFV. A pharmacology substudy obtained 12-hour AUCs in 42 subjects. In the RTV arms, SQV CL was 63.3% of the CL in the NFV arms, and F was 90% greater. The SQV half-life was 4.5 hours with RTV vs 2.8 hours with NFV. SQV CL was 49% faster in those arms containing ADV. No significant effect on SQV CL or F was noted for the presence/absence of DLV in the regimen. In conclusion, RTV produced a greater decrease in SQV CL than NFV. Interestingly, F was also greater in the RTV arms. These findings suggest differential inhibitory mechanisms of RTV vs. NFV on SQV CL and F. Overall, RTV caused a 3-fold increase in SQV exposure compared with NFV. ADV significantly decreased SQV half-life to 1.9 hours.<br /><em>Quantitation of Sex Differences and Drug Interactions: Pharmacologic Studies of Saquinavir (SQV) in ACTG 359.

<p>A study was conducted with 38 participants split into six different groups A&#8211;F. Groups A and B received saquinavir and ritonavir plus delavirdine (A) or adefovir dipivoxil (B), group C received all four drugs. Groups D, E and F were as A, B and C but received nelfinavir instead of ritonavir.

Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

                    <span>An intravenous (IV) single-bolus injection of alcuronium (0.25 mg/kg = ED95) was administered to 10 patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery during nitrous-oxide opioid anesthesia. Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

                    <span><p>The co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir and other protease inhibitors has not been studied, but would be expected to increase exposure to other protease inhibitors. Therefore, such co-administration is not recommended. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and saquinavir soft gel capsules (1200 mg once daily) increased saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 4.39-, 5.49- and 6.86-fold respectively (n=7). The combination of atazanavir and saquinavir 1200 mg once daily produced daily saquinavir exposures similar to the values produced by the standard therapeutic dosing of saquinavir 1200 mg three times daily. However, the Cmax was ~79% higher than for the standard dosing of saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules) alone at 1200 mg three times daily. Appropriate dosing recommendations for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Coadministration of atazanavir may increase saquinavir concentrations In a clinical study, saquinavir soft gel 1200 mg coadministered with atazanavir 400 mg and tenofovir 300 mg (all given once daily) plus NTRIs did not provide adequate efficacy. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration is contraindicated in combination with Invirase/ritonavir due to the potential for life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. No clinical data available for the combination of saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily and atazanavir. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1600/100 mg once daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) increased saquinavir AUC and Cmax by 60% and 42%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC and Cmax values were increased by 41% and 34% respectively, whereas pharmacokinetic parameters of atazanavir remained unchanged. <br /><em>Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<div>Atazanavir in combination with saquinavir/ritonavir should be used with caution. Additive effects on PR interval prolongation may occur with saquinavir/ritonavir. Coadministration of atazanavir (300 mg once daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1600/100 mg once daily) was evaluated in 18 HIV+ subjects. Saquinavir AUC and Cmax increased by 60% and 42%, respectively; ritonavir concentrations increased and there was no change in atazanavir concentrations.&nbsp; <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em> 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The pharmacokinetics of hard gel saquinavir/ritonavir (1600/100 mg once daily) alone and with atazanavir (150 mg, 200 mg or 300 mg once daily) was investigated in 14 HIV+ patients. Coadministration of all doses of atazanavir resulted in statistically significant increases in saquinavir Ctrough (~2-fold), Cmax (~40-50%) and AUC (~50-60%). Only the highest atazanavir dose (300 mg) had any effect on ritonavir exposure (increased Cmax and AUC). Saquinavir trough concentrations were below target (100 ng/ml) in 3/14 patients receiving atazanavir 150 mg, 3/14 patients receiving atazanavir 200 mg, and 1/14 patients receiving atazanavir 300 mg. Atazanavir trough concentrations were above target (100 ng/ml) in all patients. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard gel / ritonavir in combination with different doses of atazanavir once daily in HIV+ patients.

<div>
<p>Steady state plasma concentrations of atazanavir, saquinavir and ritonavir were obtained from 40 HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily). Data were compared to historical values obtained from 50 patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) or 100 patients receiving saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily). Atazanavir exposure was higher in the triple PI group than in the atazanavir/ritonavir group (AUC 48383 vs 37583 ng/ml.h, Cmax 4625 vs 3295 ng/ml, Cmin 584 vs 584 ng/ml). In the triple PI group (vs saquinavir/ritonavir group), saquinavir AUC and Cmin decreased (AUC 25931 vs 35928 ng/ml.h, Cmin 384 vs 437 ng/ml), however Cmax increased (3735 vs 2805 ng/ml). Ritonavir exposure was lower in the triple PI group than in either the saquinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir group. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions of atazanavir and saquinavir in a ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor therapy regimen. von Hentig NH, Haberl A, Lutz T, et al. 7th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, November 2004, abstract P276.</em></p>
<p>The elimination half-lives of saquinavir were determined following various doses and dosing regimens of saquinavir/ritonavir alone and with fosamprenavir or atazanavir. No significant change in saquinavir half-life was observed when comparing different doses and dosing regimens, with the exception of the atazanavir containing regimen (saquinavir/ritonavir/atazanavir 1600/100/300 mg once daily). This showed a significantly higher saquinavir half-life when compared to that obtained with saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily (4.49 vs 3.23 h). Saquinavir half-life is independent of saquinavir dose, ritonavir dosing intervals or presence of fosamprenavir. Atazanavir significantly increases saquinavir elimination half-life, suggesting that atazanavir has an additional impact on saquinavir elimination compared to the administration of ritonavir alone. <br /><em>Atazanavir but not ritonavir impacts the elimination half-life of saquinavir hard gel in HIV+ subjects.

<p>Addition of atazanavir (300 mg once daily) to a saquinavir/ritonavir regimen (1600/100 mg once daily) increased saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 42%, 60% and 112% respectively (n=18). Atazanavir concentrations were in accordance with historical data from atazanavir/ritonavir regimens. <br /><em>Atazanavir enhances saquinavir hard gel concentrations in a ritonavir-boosted once daily regimen.

<div><strong>Unboosted Saquinavir/Atazanavir<br /></strong>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/atazanavir combinations given twice daily were investigated in 16 HIV- subjects and compared to data obtained when saquinavir was given with low dose ritonavir. Saquinavir/atazanavir 1500/200 mg twice daily led to the achievement of saquinavir concentrations which were significantly lower than those measured in the presence of low dose ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily). However, the median (range) saquinavir Cmin measured was 129 (12-425) ng/ml, with 75% of the subjects showing concentrations higher than the suggested threshold of 100 ng/ml. Interestingly, atazanavir Cmax was 55% lower and Cmin 96% higher than those measured when atazanavir is administered at a dose of 400 mg once daily. Saquinavir did not alter atazanavir plasma concentrations. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of saquinavir with low-dose ritonavir or atazanavir twice daily in seronegative volunteers: ASPIRE II.

<div>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (1600/100 mg once daily) and saquinavir/atazanavir (1600/400 or 2000/400 mg once daily) were investigated in healthy volunteers. Saquinavir median pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly higher with ritonavir (Cmax 3783 ng.ml, Cmin 87 ng/ml, AUC 26.79 mg/L.h) than with atazanavir (SQV 1600 mg, Cmax 1519 ng.ml, Cmin &lt;25 ng/ml, AUC 7.06 mg/L.h; SQV 2000 mg Cmax 2500 ng.ml, Cmin 30 ng/ml, AUC 10.61 mg/L.h). Atazanavir exposure was similar between the two saquinavir doses and was comparable to historical data. Men had significantly lower Cmax and AUC parameters for all three PIs than women, after adjusting for weight. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of once-daily saquinavir hard-gel capsule with low-dose ritonavir or full dose atazanavir in seronegative volunteers: ASPIRE I.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Coadminsitration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and saquinavir (1200 mg once daily) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir (ATV Cmin 206 vs 87 ng/ml; Cmax 5669 vs 5034 ng/ml; alone vs +SQV). A higher proportion of patients with atazanavir Cmin below the IC90 (14 ng/ml) was observed with saquinavir than when give alone. Saquinavir Cmin was below the minimum effective concentration (100 ng/ml) in 6/7 patients. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of atazanavir alone and coadministered with saquinavir hard gel once daily.

                      <span>In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone -17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily)  and inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

<div>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<div><br />The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated by cytochrome P450, with the specific isoenzyme CYP3A4 responsible for 90 % of the hepatic metabolism. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that saquinavir is a substrate and an inhibitor for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, medicinal products that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 and/or P-gp activity may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir.Similarly, saquinavir might also modify the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products that are substrates for CYP3A4 or P-gp.<br /><em>Invirase&#174; (saquinavir) 500mg Film-Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Limited, updated July 2012</em></div></div></span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated by cytochrome P450, with the specific isoenzyme CYP3A4 responsible for 90 % of the hepatic metabolism. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that saquinavir is a substrate and an inhibitor for P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene. Ghobadi C, Gregory A, Crewe HK, Rostami-Hodjegan A, Lennard MS. Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 2008;23(2):101-5.</em></p>
<p>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir.

<p>Coadministration of saquinavir hard gel (1000 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 14 subjects. Darunavir exposure was decreased and saquinavir exposure was increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 17%, 26% and 42%, respectively.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between a non-licensed dose darunavir/ritonavir and saquinavir were investigated in HIV- healthy volunteers who were randomized into two cohorts (panel 1 and panel 2). Panel 1 received darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) alone and with saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily). Panel 2 received saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) alone and with darunavir (400 mg twice daily). Coadministration decreased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 26%, 17% and 42%, respectively compared with administration of darunavir alone. Relative to treatment with saquinavir/ritonavir alone, saquinavir exposure was not significantly different with the addition of darunavir. Similar findings are expected with the approved 600/100 mg twice daily darunavir/ritonavir dose. Based on the decrease in darunavir Cmin, the combination of saquinavir and darunavir/ritonavir is currently not recommended. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between darunavir and saquinavir in HIV-negative volunteers.

                      <span>A clinical study reported that saquinavir had no effect on daunorubicin pharmacokinetics (liposomal). An in vitro study has shown that daunorubicin was able to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, but was unlikely to cause clinically significant drug interactions via this mechanism. Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of daunorubicin treatment and may include: dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities.

Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></div>

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<p>Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of treatment with daunorubicin hydrochloride and may include: dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities (ST-T wave changes, low voltage QRS complex, T waves). Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, endomyocardial fibrosis, pericarditis/myocarditis have also been reported. Careful monitoring of cardiac function before, during and after treatment is therefore recommended in order to identify the risk of cardiac complications as early as possible. Risk factors for cardiac toxicity include active or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/ pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility; or cardiotoxic drugs.<br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></p>

Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration is predicted to increase the conversion to the active metabolite etonogestrel due to inhibition of CYP3A4. When used in a combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced.

The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase dihydrocodeine exposure (inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) and increase the conversion to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide (induction of UGT2B7).

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter saquinavir/ritonavir exposure.</span>

                    <span><p>The effect of echinacea on CYP activity was assessed by use of a number of CYP probe drugs (caffeine for CYP1A2; tolbutamide for CYP2C9; dextromethorphan for CYP2D6 and midazolam for both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A) in a study in 12 healthy volunteers. The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted. Certainly echinacea could contribute to inter-patient variability in protease inhibitor levels. <br /><em>The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) root on cytochrome P450 activity in vivo.

<p>Coadministration of soft gel saquinavir/ritonavir (1200/100 mg once daily) with efavirenz (600 mg) in 19 patients resulted in a saquinavir Cmax, Cmin and AUC of 2.49 &#181;g/ml, 0.24 &#181;g/ml and 18.98 &#181;g.h/ml, respectively. Efavirenz Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 5.73 &#181;g/ml, 2.44 g/ml and 86.39 &#181;g.h/ml, respectively. Saquinavir levels were lower than previously described with higher once daily doses. This could be due to the lower dose or the presence of efavirenz.

<p>The effect of adding efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg bd) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Efavirenz had no effect on the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of saquinavir or ritonavir after 6 weeks of therapy. After 6 months of therapy, saquinavir and ritonavir Cmin were stable, however, there was a 27% decrease in saquinavir AUC and a 30% decrease in ritonavir AUC (compared to 6 week data). Therefore, efavirenz does not affect the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir or ritonavir when given in at a dose of 400/400 mg bd. The AUC and Cmax, but not the half life, of saquinavir and ritonavir decreased after long term administration suggesting changing bioavailability over time. <br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir 400/400 mg bid before, and after short- and long-term coadministration with efavirenz 600 mg qd. van Heeswijk R, Cooper C, Gallicano K, et al. 3rd International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Washington, 2002, abstract 7.4</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg bd) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers.

The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as ritonavir&nbsp;may reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3.

No clinically significant interaction was noted. No dose adjustment required. <br /><em>Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of enfuvirtide (90 mg sc every 12 hours for 7 days) with saquinavir/ritonavir (soft gel, 1000/100 mg twice daily), in 12 patients, caused no alteration in enfuvirtide AUC or Cmax. No clinically significant interaction was noted from a study in 12 HIV patients who received enfuvirtide concomitantly with saquinavir/ritonavir (soft gel, 1000/100 mg twice daily). No dose adjustments are required. <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of saquinavir(1000 mg twice daily for 4 days with 100 mg ritonavir) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects results in no change in enfuvirtide Cmax, and increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively.<br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily, sc) with either ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, n=12) or saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily, n=12) was investigated in HIV+ patients. Although bioequivalence criteria were not met for coadministration of enfuvirtide with and without ritonavir, the increase in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin were small (22, 24 and 14%, respectively) and not clinically relevant. When administered with ritonavir-boosted saquinavir there was a 14, 7 and 25% increase in AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively and bioequivalence criteria were met for AUC and Cmax. Thus, no dosage adjustments are warranted when enfuvirtide is coadministered with low-dose ritonavir or low-dose ritonavir-boosted saquinavir. <br /><em>Lack of interaction between enfuvirtide and ritonavir or ritonavir-boosted saquinavir in HIV-infected patients.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and etonogestrel implants increased etonogestrel exposure (52%, 61%, and 34% increases in AUC, Cmax, and Cmin, respectively) suggesting that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of etonogestrel implants. Similarly, coadministration with saquinavir could potentially increase etonogestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only etonogestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception. </span>

<p>Etravirine should not be co-administered with PIs without low-dose ritonavir. Concomitant use of etravirine with PIs without coadministration of low-dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentrations of the PI. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) of etravirine was reduced when etravirine was co-administered with saquinavir/ritonavir. Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of saquinavir/ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, etravirine and saquinavir/ritonavir can be co-administered without any dose adjustments. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lopinavir/Saquinavir/Ritonavir</strong><br />The effect of adding etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) to a regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus saquinavir (800 or 1000 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration had no statistically significant effect on saquinavir AUC (13% decrease), Cmax (15% decrease) or Cmin (13% decrease). Similarly, ritonavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered (13% decrease in AUC, 11% decrease in Cmax, 12% decrease in Cmin). However, there was a statistically significant decrease in lopinavir AUC (18%) and Cmax (16%), but the decrease in Cmin (24%) was not significant.

                    <span><p>The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid present in fish oil, on CYP3A-mediated metabolism of saquinavir was investigated in vitro using rat liver microsomes. The effect of DHA on the bioavailability of saquinavir was also investigated in rats. DHA showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of saquinavir metabolism with Km, Vmax and Ki values of 2.21 &#181;M, 0.054 &#181;mol/h/mg protein and 149.6 &#181;M, respectively. After oral co-administration with 250 &#181;g/kg DHA, the bioavailability of saquinavir significantly increased (~4-fold) with AUC and Cmax increasing by approximately 3.3-fold and 2.9-fold, respectively; there was no effect on the elimination half-life. The pharmacokinetic interaction occurred only when DHA was taken simultaneously with oral administration of saquinavir; there was no effect when saquinavir was administered 2 h after DHA or when saquinavir was administered intravenously.<br /><em>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits saquinavir metabolism in-vitro and enhances its bioavailability in rats.

<div>Dose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals have been observed in healthy volunteers receiving ritonavir-boosted saquinavir. Concomitant use of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir with other medicinal products that prolong the QT and/or PR interval is therefore contraindicated.<br /><em>Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, March 2012.</em></div>

<p>Saquinavir is contraindicated in patients with congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation, patients with refractory hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or those on concomitant therapy with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.<br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, October 2012.</em></p></div>
<p>Fluphenazine is metabolised by P450 2D6 and is itself an inhibitor of this drug metabolising enzyme. The plasma concentrations and the effects of fluphenazine may therefore be increased and prolonged by drugs that are either the substrates or inhibitors of this P450 isoform, possibly resulting in severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects. The effects of phenothiazines on the heart are dose-related. ECG changes with prolongation of the QT interval and T-Wave changes have been reported commonly in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have also occurred after overdosage. Sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths have been reported in hospitalised psychotic patients receiving phenothiazines. The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, concurrent use of these drugs and fluphenazine is contraindicated.<br /><em>Modecate Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-aventis, December 2011.</em></p>

<p>The effect of amprenavir on saquinavir is not well established. Coadministration of saquinavir (800 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) and amprenavir (750 or 800 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) to 7 subjects resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 37%, 32% and 14% respectively.

<p>Coadministration of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (800 mg three times daily) and amprenavir (800 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Saquinavir AUC was decreased by 18% and Cmax increased by 21% in the presence of amprenavir. There was a 36% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir, a 40% decrease in Cmax and no change in Cmin.

<p>The effects of coadministration of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily) and low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) on the plasma concentrations of amprenavir and saquinavir was studied in small (n=4 or 5) groups of HIV-infected patients. Saquinavir AUC values were 17.4 &#177; 7.6 &#181;g/ml.h in the presence of ritonavir and 15.9 &#177; 14.4 &#181;g/ml.h in the presence of ritonavir and amprenavir; Cmin values were 0.62 &#177; 0.37 and 0.46 &#177; 0.17 &#181;g/ml. Amprenavir AUC values were 60.1 &#177; 15.0 &#181;g/ml.h in the presence of ritonavir and 36.1 &#177; 7.1 &#181;g/ml.h in the presence of ritonavir and saquinavir; Cmin values were 3.0 &#177; 0.61 and 1.85 &#177;0.41 &#181;g/ml.

<p><strong>Fosamprenavir + Saquinavir + Ritonavir (low dose)</strong></p>
<p>Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) with saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) decreased saquinavir AUC and Cmax by 15% and 9%, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 18 HIV+ subjects. Saquinavir AUC decreased by 15% and there was no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of saquinavir (hard gel, 1000 mg twice daily) with fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) with ritonavir (100 or 200 mg twice daily) was investigated in 18 HIV+ patients. When fosamprenavir was added to the regimen containing 1000/100 mg saquinavir/ritonavir there was a 14, 9 and 24% decrease in saquinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively, although this was not statistically significant. When ritonavir dose was increased to 200 mg ritonavir this small and insignificant decrease was restored. This study also showed that the double boosted PI combination of saquinavir/ritonavir/fosamprenavir was well tolerated over the study period (22 days).<br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir/fosamprenavir in HIV-1-infected patients.

<p><strong>Amprenavir/Saquinavir/Efavirenz</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

                    <span><p>The effect of <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> extract (120 mg twice daily for 4 weeks) on the steady state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) or single doses of midazolam (8 mg) was studied in 14 HIV- subjects. Coadministration had no effect on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations, but decreased midazolam AUC by 34% and Cmax by 31%. The results suggest that Gingko biloba extract is unlikely to reduce exposure of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, but unboosted regimens may be affected. <br /><em>Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on lopinavir, midazolam and fexofenadine pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin.

<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Saquinavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of saquinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as saquinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.</em> <em>Hamberg P, Steeghs N, Loos WJ et al.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

<p>Coadministration of a single 600 mg dose of the hard gel formulation of saquinavir with indinavir (800 mg three time daily for 2 days) to 6 subjects resulted in increases in saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 4.7-, 6.0- and 2.9-fold respectively. Coadministration of a single 800 mg dose of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir with indinavir (800 mg three time daily for 2 days) to 6 subjects resulted in increases in saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 6.5-, 7.2- and 5.5-fold respectively. Coadministration of a single 1200 mg dose of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir with indinavir (800 mg three time daily for 2 days) to 6 subjects resulted in increases in saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 4.0-, 4.6- and 5.5-fold respectively. The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and a single dose of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (800 or 1200 mg single dose) was studied in six healthy volunteers. The 800 mg saquinavir dose showed a 620% increase in AUC and a 551% increase in Cmax. The 1200 mg saquinavir dose showed a 364% increase in AUC and a 299% increase in Cmax. There were no apparent clinically relevant changes to indinavir pharmacokinetics when coadministered with the soft gel formulation of saquinavir. <br /><em>Saquinavir soft gel capsules (Fortovase) pharmacokinetics and drug interactions.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) with a single dose of the hard gel formulation of saquinavir (600 mg) was studied in six healthy volunteers. Indinavir increased the AUC and Cmax of saquinavir by 5&#8211;8 fold. An increase of this magnitude is not expected to influence the safety profile of saquinavir. Hence, no dosage adjustment of saquinavir (or indinavir) is recommended.<br /><em>Indinavir &#8211; saquinavir single dose pharmacokinetic study.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) with saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily), in 12 healthy volunteers, increased ketoconazole AUC by 168% and increased Cmax by 45%. When the same doses were studied in 20 healthy volunteers, there was no significant change in saquinavir AUC or Cmax. When saquinavir/ritonavir and ketoconazole are coadministered, plasma concentrations of ketoconazole are increased. Hence doses of ketoconazole &gt;200 mg/day are not recommended. <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir, ritonavir and ketoconazole were investigated in healthy subjects receiving saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) alone and in combination. Coadministration had no clinically significant effect on the AUC or Cmax of saquinavir (7% and 2% increases, respectively) or ritonavir (12% and 8% increases respectively). However, the AUC of ketoconazole increased by 2.68-fold and Cmax increased by1.45-fold. Ketoconazole half life increased from 4.3 h to 10.7 h and CL/F decreased by more than 50% (from 8.22 to 3.07 L/h). In this study the increase in ketoconazole exposure with saquinavir/ritonavir was not associated with unacceptable safety or tolerability. No dose adjustment of saquinavir or ritonavir is required when administered with doses of ketoconazole of 200 mg/day or lower. Based on the hepatotoxicity liability of ketoconazole, high doses (&gt;200 mg/day) are not recommended. <br /><em>Drug-drug interaction study of ketoconazole and ritonavir-boosted saquinavir. Kaeser B, Zandt H, Bour F, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2009, 53(2): 609-614.</em></p>
<p>A study confirmed that ketoconazole had relatively weak boosting properties when compared to ritonavir. In a single group, two-period design, 25 virologically and immunologically stable patients on saquinavir/ritonavir (2000/100 mg once daily) were switched to saquinavir/ketoconazole (2000/400 mg once daily) for two weeks. The mean saquinavir AUC during boosting with ritonavir was 57.93 &#177; 27.96 mg.h/L, Cmax was 7.50 &#177; 3.45 mg/L and Cmin was 0.35 &#177; 0.30 mg/L. When ketoconazole was used, saquinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were 12.00 &#177; 6.97 mg.h/L, 2.43 &#177; 1.35 mg/L and 0.03 &#177; 0.04 mg/L, respectively. Boosting with ketoconazole resulted in 80% lower exposure to saquinavir with concentrations at 24 h below the recommended trough concentrations of 0.1 mg/L. Boosting of saquinavir by ketoconazole is not recommended. <br /><em>Ketoconazole is inferior to ritonavir as an alternative booster for saquinavir in a once daily regimen in Thai HIV-1 infected patients.

<p>There was no significant change in ketoconazole AUC or Cmax when administered (400 mg once daily) with the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (1200 mg three times daily) to 12 healthy volunteers. Saquinavir AUC was increased by 190% and Cmax increases by 171% in the presence of ketoconazole. No dose adjustment is required when the two drugs are coadministered for a limited time at the doses studied.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with saquinavir soft gelatin capsules.

<p>The effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (1200 mg three time daily) was studied in healthy volunteers (400 mg once daily) and HIV+ patients (200 mg once daily).

<p>Twelve HIV+ individuals received 400 mg twice daily of ritonavir and the hard gel formulation of saquinavir bd with 200 mg or 400 mg of ketoconazole. The AUC, Cmax and half-life of saquinavir increased by 37, 94 and 38%, respectively. The effect on the CSF concentration was insignificant. It was concluded that ketoconazole inhibits CYP3A and transport systems such as P-glycoprotein or MRP-1.<br /><em>Effect of ketoconazole on ritonavir and saquinavir concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Similarly, saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

Concomitant saquinavir administration reduced apparent oral clearance of loperamide, resulting in a 40% increase in loperamide AUC (116 vs 164 pmol.h/ml). Coadministration of loperamide reduced saquinavir AUC and Cmax by 54%(1189 vs 550 pmol.h/ml) and 46% (404 vs 217 pmol.h/ml) respectively.

There were no statistically significant differences in lopinavir or saquinavir trough concentrations when given in combination and compared to a reference population receiving saquinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Compared to patients receiving saquinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir trough concentrations were significantly decreased in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir or saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lack of drug-drug interaction between lopinavir and saquinavir based on their trough plasma concentrations in highly HIV-experienced patients treated with Kaletra and Invirase.

<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg) on saquinavir (800 mg twice daily) was studied in healthy subjects. When compared to saquinavir 1200 mg three times daily, the study regimen produced substantially higher saquinavir concentration with ratios of central values for Cmax, AUC and Cmin being 6.3, 9.6 and 16.7 respectively. Lopinavir concentrations were similar to historical data. <br /><em>Assessment of the steady state pharmacokinetic interaction of lopinavir/ritonavir with either indinavir or saquinavir in healthy subjects.

<p>A study was performed (n=48) combining lopinavir/r (400/100 mg twice daily) with saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily). It did not show a disadvantageous pharmacokinetic interaction on lopinavir/r or saquinavir. The low ritonavir plasma levels were effective at boosting both lopinavir and saquinavir levels.<br /><em>A new strategy: boosted double protease inhibitor regimen lopinavir/r plus saquinavir without reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>Coadministration of methadone (60-120 mg once daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) was studied in 12 methadone-dependent, HIV-negative subjects. The AUC of R-methadone decreased by 19%. Use with caution. Additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with saquinavir/ritonavir.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of total, R- and S-methadone were determined in 12 HIV- subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy (60-120 mg per day) when given alone or in combination with saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily). Coadministration with saquinavir/ritonavir decreased systemic exposure of R-methadone by 18.6%; however, there were no signs or symptoms of methadone withdrawal. The decrease in R-methadone exposure is not clinically relevant and the triple combination was well tolerated. <br /><em>Effect of boosted saquinavir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of racemic methadone in opiate-dependent patients on stable methadone maintenance therapy.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of methadone were examined in 12 HIV+ subjects prior to and 14 days into ritonavir/saquinavir therapy. There was a ~14% decrease in the AUC of free R-methadone, but the overall pharmacokinetic interaction was small and stereospecific. None of the 12 subjects complained of narcotic withdrawal or excessive sedation and no one required methadone dose escalation.<br /><em>The effect of ritonavir/saquinavir on stereoselective pharmacokinetics of methadone: results of AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) 401.

Delayed excretion and accumulation of this metabolite occur in patients with renal insufficiency and may cause an increased hypotensive effect during methyldopa therapy. Unabsorbed methyldopa is excreted in the feces unchanged.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

<p>Coadministration of saquinavir and ORAL midazolam is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by saquinavir/ritonavir could result in elevated plasma concentrations of this drug, potentially causing serious or life threatening side effects, such as increased sedation or respiratory depression. Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher with oral than parenteral administration. If saquinavir is coadministered with PARENTERAL midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustment should be considered. Coadministration of midazolam (7.5 mg, single oral dose) with saquinavir (soft gel, 1200 mg three times daily for 5 days), in 6 healthy volunteers, resulted in a 514% and 235% increase in midazolam AUC and Cmax, respectively. <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>There is a case report of prolonged excessive sedative effects of midazolam (5 mg intravenously) when given with the hard gel formulation of saquinavir (600 mg three times daily). A patient did not wake spontaneously and required therapeutic intervention and was not free of sedative effects until 5 h later. There had been no previous problems in absence of saquinavir. <br /><em>Saquinavir interaction with midazolam: pharmacokinetic considerations when prescribing protease inhibitors for patients with HIV disease. Merry C, Mulcahy F, Barry M, et al. AIDS, 1997, 11:268&#8211;9. </em></p>
<p>Coadministration of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (1200 mg three times daily) and intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) or oral midazolam (7.5 mg) was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. The AUC of midazolam given intravenously increased 2.5-fold in the presence of saquinavir, clearance was decreased by 56% and half-life was increased from 4.1 to 9.5 h. There was a 5-fold increase in the AUC of midazolam given orally and a 2.3-fold increase in Cmax. Bioavailability of the oral dose increased from 41 to 90% and half-life was increased from 4.3 to 10.9 h. During treatment with saquinavir, the dose of oral midazolam should be greatly reduced or avoided. Bolus intravenous doses of midazolam can probably be used quite safely, but the sedative effect may last longer. During long term infusions, an initial dose reduction of 50% followed by careful titration is recommended to counteract the decreased clearance. <br /><em>Effect of saquinavir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral and intravenous midazolam.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form.

It is also a substrate of P-gp. Coadministration may increase mirabegron concentrations, however, only a modest increase in mirabegron exposure was observed with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/P-gp). No dose adjustment is recommended when mirabegron is combined with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp in patients with normal hepatic or renal function. However, a dose decrease of mirabegron to 25 mg once daily in patients is recommended for patients who have mildly impaired hepatic or renal function and who are taking a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.</p></span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

<p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) and a single dose of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (1200 mg) was studied in 14 HIV+ individuals. There was a 392% increase in saquinavir AUC and a 179% increase in Cmax. The AUC of nelfinavir was increased by 18% in the presence of saquinavir, but there was no change in Cmax. The safety and efficacy of this combination are under investigation.<br /><em>Saquinavir soft gel capsule (Fortovase) pharmacokinetics and drug interactions.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Neostigmine is thought to undergo a degree of hepatic metabolism, although the mechanisms are unknown. However, as metabolism also occurs via hydrolysis by cholinesterase and up to 50% of a dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is little potential for clinically significant interaction with antiretrovirals via liver enzyme modification.</span>

                    <span><p>Neostigmine undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterase and is also metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

It is rapidly and extensively metabolised and relatively low concentrations of nifurtimox appear in the plasma and tissues. It is presumed to cross the blood-brain barrier.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

<p>When saquinavir/ritonavir is co-administered with omeprazole, saquinavir concentrations are increased significantly. Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily for 5 days) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 15 days) was studied in 19 HIV- subjects. Saquinavir AUC increased by 82% and Cmax increased by 75%. If omeprazole is taken concomitantly with saquinavir/ritonavir, caution is advised and monitoring for potential saquinavir toxicities is recommended, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, increased triglycerides, deep vein thrombosis and QT prolongation.<br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics and safety of saquinavir/ritonavir were investigated when administered with omeprazole (40 mg) simultaneously and 2 h apart to 12 HIV+ subjects. Geometric mean (90% CI) for saquinavir AUC (ng.h/ml), Ctrough (ng/ml) and Cmax ng/ml) were 14,698 (13,242&#8211;20,636), 433 (368&#8211;758), 2,513 (2,243&#8211;3,329) without omeprazole; 22,646 (18,536&#8211;131,861), 750 (619&#8211;1,280), 3,890 (3,223&#8211;5,133) with omeprazole simultaneously; and 24,549 (20,884&#8211;38,894), 851 (720&#8211;1,782), 4,141 (3,554&#8211;5,992) with omeprazole 2 h earlier. Simultaneous administration of omeprazole significantly increased saquinavir AUC, Ctrough, and Cmax by 54%, 73%, and 55%, whereas staggered administration (2 h apart) increased AUC, Ctrough and Cmax by 67%, 97%, and 65%. No grade 3/4 toxicity or lab abnormalities were observed. In the presence of omeprazole, saquinavir plasma exposure is significantly increased in HIV+ subjects whether administered simultaneously or 2 h apart. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of saquinavir/ritonavir and omeprazole in HIV-infected subjects.

<p>Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained in 18 healthy subjects receiving saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) alone or in combination with omeprazole (40 mg once daily). Saquinavir exposure was increased in the presence of omeprazole &#8211; Ctrough increased 2-fold, Cmax increased by 75% and AUC increased by 82%. No significant changes were observed in ritonavir pharmacokinetics. Despite the significant increase in saquinavir exposure, no short term toxicity was observed.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

However, the US Prescribing Information recommends that quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if coadministered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.

                    <span><p>Vitamin A substances are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but absorption may be reduced in the presence of fat malabsorption, low protein intake, or impaired liver or pancreatic function. Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. It is released from the liver bound to a specific &#945;1-globulin (retinol-binding protein) in the blood. The retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid; these and other metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), latest modification: 05-Dec-2011</em> </p>
<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites. As the dose increases, larger amounts are excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                      <span>Do not coadminister with unboosted saquinavir. Coadministration with saquinavir/ritonavir had no significant effect on saquinavir or ritonavir, but increased exposure to rifabutin and its active metabolite. Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor, thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).</span>

Rifabutin AUC and Cmax increased by 53% and 86%, respectively; total rifabutin activity increased by 134% (AUC) and 130% (Cmax). To prevent possible development of rifabutin resistance in TB and HIV co-infected patients, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg every other day or three times per week, with the dose of saquinavir/ritonavir unchanged (1000/100 mg twice daily).

No dose adjustment of saquianvir/ritonavir (1000/100mg twice daily) is required if ritonavir-boosted saquinavir is administered in combination with rifabutin. Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week).

<div>The pharmacokinetic interaction between rifabutin and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) was assessed in healthy subjects.&nbsp; Rifabutin was administered at 150 mg once daily when given alone and at 150 mg every 3 days (n=14) and every 4 days (n=13) when given with saquinavir/ritonavir.&nbsp; When given every 3 days, rifabutin reduced saquinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 13%, 15%, and 9%, respectively.&nbsp; No effects of rifabutin on ritonavir AUC, Cmax or Cmin were observed.&nbsp; Rifabutin AUC increased by 53% and Cmax increased by 86%. The AUC and Cmax of the active moiety (rifabutin plus 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin) increased by 134% and 130%, respectively, compared with administration of rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone.&nbsp; When rifabutin was coadministered every 4 days, there was no change in rifabutin AUC and Cmax increased by 68%, compared to rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone. The AUC and Cmax of the active moiety increased by 60% and 111%, respectively.&nbsp; No adjustment of the saquinavir/ritonavir dose is required when the drugs are administered in combination with rifabutin. Although the pharmacokinetic results of this study support the administration of rifabutin 150 mg every 4 days, it should be noted that the rifabutin exposure determined in healthy subjects may not be sufficient to control acquired rifamycin resistance in the patient population.&nbsp; The authors acknowledge that more frequent dosing (e.g. 150 mg three times a week or every other day) may be needed to treat HIV patients with active TB in order to prevent acquired rifamycin resistance.&nbsp; Monitoring of neutropenia and liver enzyme levels is recommended for patients receiving rifabutin with saquinavir/ritonavir.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction study of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir in combination with rifabutin in healthy subjects.

Group 1 received 300 mg rifabutin every 7 days and group 2 150 mg every 3 days for 8 weeks. Rifabutin exposures were similar at 4 and 8 weeks and had minimal effect on ritonavir and saquinavir.

<p>A study to investigate whether RTV boosting of SQV could overcome the reduction in SQV exposure by rifampicin was discontinued early due to unexpected hepatic adverse events in 11 subjects. Fourteen healthy volunteers were recruited into each arm of a two period crossover study: Group 1 - SQV/RTV 1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days followed by SQV/RTV + rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 14 days; Group 2 &#8211; rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 14 days followed by rifampicin + SQV/RTV 1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days. Day 14 steady state concentrations of SQV, RTV, rifampicin and desacetyl-rifampicin were within expected ranges. Elevated grade 1 transaminases levels were reported by day 14 in 2/14 subjects receiving rifampicin alone. Dosing was continued beyond day 14 in 17/28 subjects, 11 of whom developed elevated transaminases levels resulting in the discontinuation of the study. Grades 2 and 3 adverse events were reported in 2 subjects in group 1, with 9 subjects in group 2 reporting grades 3 and 4 adverse events. Clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were generally more common and severe in group 2 than group 1. The limited data available suggested a trend towards increased desacetyl-rifampicin concentrations and a possible causal relationship between concentrations and elevated transaminases. Clinical symptoms resolved and transaminase levels reduced following discontinuation of study drugs. Although limited data warrants cautious interpretation, they suggest that the hepatotoxicity was mediated by direct and/or indirect effects of rifampicin exposure. Rifampicin should not be administered to patients also receiving boosted SQV. <br /><em>Unexpected hepatotoxicity observed in a healthy volunteer study on the effects of multiple dose rifampicin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir and vice versa.

<div>The recommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg (2 x 500 mg film-coated tablets) two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. For treatment-naive patients initiating treatment with Invirase/ritonavir, the starting recommended dose of Invirase is 500 mg (1 x 500 mg film-coated tablet) two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the first 7 days of treatment. After 7 days, the recommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients switching immediately from treatment with another protease inhibitor taken with ritonavir or from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor based regimen, without a wash-out period, should however initiate and continue Invirase at the standard recommended dose of 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily. Invirase film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and taken at the same time as ritonavir with or after food. In HIV-infected patients, Invirase or saquinavir soft capsules in combination with ritonavir at doses of 1000/100 mg twice daily provide a systemic exposure of saquinavir over a 24 hour period similar to or greater than that achieved with saquinavir soft capsules 1200 mg three times daily.<br /><em>Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012.</em></div>
<p>Inivrase (1000 mg twice daily) must be used in combination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) because it significantly inhibits saquinavir's metabolism to provide increased plasma saquinavir levels. When ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 14 days) was coadministered with saquinavir (soft gel 400 mg twice daily for 14 days), in 8 healthy volunteers, saquinavir AUC and Cmax increased by 121% and 64%, respectively, compared to standard soft gel regimen (1200 mg three times daily, n=33). When ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with saquinavir (hard gel 1000 mg twice daily, steady state), in 24 patients, saquinavir AUC and Cmax were increased by 1124% and 1325%, respectively, compared to standard saquinavir hard gel 600 mg (three times daily) regimen(n=114). <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Saquinavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Initiate treatment with saquinavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, then saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART-na&#239;ve patients. Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used. Higher doses of ritonavir have been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Co-administration of saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse events, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 15-fold and Cmin by 5-fold; ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 17-fold with no change in ritonavir AUC or Cmin. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of saquinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Saquinavir should only be given in combination with ritonavir. Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily provides saquinavir systemic exposure over 24 hours similar to or greater than those achieved with saquinavir 1200 mg three times daily without ritonavir. Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given together. In a clinical study investigating the interaction of rifampicin 600 mg once daily and saquinavir 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in healthy volunteers, severe hepatocellular toxicity with transaminase elevations up to &gt;20-fold the upper limit of normal after 1 to 5 days of co-administration was noted. Due to the risk of severe hepatoxicity, saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of ritonavir, saquinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased. See the complete Prescribing Information for saquinavir for details on co-administration of saquinavir 1000 mg bid with ritonavir 100 mg bid. Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampin, due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three drugs are given together. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p></span>

<div>The interaction with saquinavir/ritonavir has not been studied. Coadministration of unboosted saquinavir (1200 mg three times daily) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) increased sildenafil Cmax by 140% and AUC by 210%.

<p>Only the combination of sildenafil with saquinavir soft gelatin capsules has been studied at doses used for treatment of erectile dysfunction. Coadministration of saquinavir and sildenafil results in increased sildenafil concentrations but saquinavir concentrations are unaltered. Coadministration of a single dose of sildenafil (100 mg) with saquinavir (soft gel 1200 mg three times daily for 8 days), in 27 healthy volunteers, caused a 210% and 140% increase in sildenafil AUC and Cmax, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (1200 mg three times daily) and a single dose of sildenafil (100 mg single dose) has been investigated in 14 healthy volunteers. Saquinavir increased sildenafil AUC by 3.1-fold and Cmax by 2.4-fold. Sildenafil did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. A sildenafil starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients receiving concomitant potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between the HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and saquinavir and Viagra (sildenafil citrate).

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Saquinavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window. The European SPC warns that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD but this has not been assessed in a clinical study. </span>

                    <span><div>In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. The effects of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting of renal impairment has not been assessed in a clinical study.<br /><em>Januvia Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp&nbsp; &amp; Dohme Ltd, August 2012.</em></div></span>

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed in some patients taking sodium stibogluconate and appears to be dose-related. There have also been reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving higher dose antimonial therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, ECG monitoring is recommended before and during therapy with sodium stibogluconate. Where ECG monitoring is not available, the risks and benefits of sodium stibogluconate therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. Sodium stibogluconate should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias or other risk factors known to predispose towards QT prolongation: for example, those with congenital QTc prolongation or taking concomitant drugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval <br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August2007</em></p>

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.<br /><em>Norvir&#174; (Ritonavir) 100mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection.

<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

<p>There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was coadministered with ritonavir-boosted saquinavir. A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.

<p>Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 35 healthy volunteers.

There was no change in ritonavir Cmax or AUC, but Cmin increased by 23%. The increases in saquinavir AUC and Cmin are not expected to be clinically relevant; hence no dose adjustments are required when tenofovir-DF and ritonavir-boosted saquinavir are coadministered. <br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) were assessed in HIV-negative subjects. No clinically relevant interactions between tenofovir-DF and saquinavir/ritonavir were noted. Steady state tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered in the presence of saquinavir/ritonavir (increases of 14% in AUC, 15% in Cmax, 23% in Cmin, n=35). Coadministration of tenofovir-DF to 32 subjects resulted in increases in saquinavir AUC (29%), Cmax (22%) and Cmin (47%). Steady state ritonavir Cmin increased by 23% in the presence of tenofovir-DF, but ritonavir AUC and Cmax were not significantly altered.

<p>The coadministration of tenofovir diproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 18 HIV-1 infected individuals receiving saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir combination (1000/100 mg twice daily).

Following the addition of tenofovir-DF, saquinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations were not significantly different compared with day 1. Geometric mean ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the AUC on days 3 and 14 were 1.16 (0.97, 1.59) and 0.99 (0.87, 1.30) for saquinavir and 1.05 (0.92, 1.28) and 1.08 (0.97, 1.30) for ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) when administered with tenofovir diproxil fumarate in HIV-1-infected subjects.

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased saquinavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As saquinavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

After parenteral administration it is excreted almost completely as microbiologically active substance (approx. 75-90% within 24 hours) through glomerular filtration via the kidneys. Biliary excretion is insignificant (less than 5% of a dose). The clearance of vancomycin from plasma correlates nearly with the glomerular filtration rate. No vancomycin metabolites have been identified so far in humans<br /><em>Vancomycin, 500 mg, powder for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Limited, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p>In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/hr, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/hr. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg.

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span>In order to better define the interaction between combination antiretroviral therapy and vinblastine (a substrate of CYP3A4), clinical charts were reviewed of all HIV infected patients in a centre in Rome who received a diagnosis of Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma as coadministration of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ritonavir, may decrease vinblastine metabolism and consequently increase vinblastine-related myelosuppression. It was found that the use of protease inhibitors was independently associated with WHO grade III-IV neutropaenia.&nbsp; Moreover, an inverse correlation between dosage of ritonavir and mean nadir neutrophil count was found.&nbsp; The concomitant administration of vinblastine-containing chemotherapy regimens with protease inhibitors can lead to higher levels of neutropaenia than those of different classes of drugs such as NNRTIs or integrase inhibitors.<br /><em>Detrimental clinical interaction between ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors and vinblastine in HIV-infected patients with Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma.

<p>Coadministration of voriconazole with high dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) is contraindicated because ritonavir significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose. Coadministration of voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. The effect of the coadministration of oral voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) and high dose (400 mg) and low dose (100 mg) oral ritonavir was investigated in two separate studies in healthy volunteers. High doses of ritonavir decreased the steady state Cmax and AUC of oral voriconazole by an average of 66% and 82%. Low doses of ritonavir decreased the Cmax and AUC of voriconazole by an average of 24% and 39% respectively. Administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on mean Cmax and AUC of ritonavir in the high dose study, although a minor decrease in steady state Cmax and AUC of ritonavir with an average of 25% and 13% respectively was observed in the low dose ritonavir interaction study.
