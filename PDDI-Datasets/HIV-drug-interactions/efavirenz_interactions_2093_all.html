                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. When antiepileptics phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital were coadministered with albendazole, significantly reduced levels of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were observed, appaprently due to induction of CYP3A4. As efavirenz may induce CYP3A4, an interaction with albendazole cannot be ruled out.</span>

                    <span><p>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

<p>Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital appear to induce the oxidative metabolism of albendazole via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A by roughly the same extent, resulting in significantly reduced concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide. This interaction is likely to be clinically significant when albendazole is used to treat systemic worm infections, and increased doses of albendazole would be needed. The interaction is probably not clinically significant when albendazole is used for intestinal worm infections. <br /><em>Lanchote VL, et al.

Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as efavirenz and nevirapine) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.<br /></em></span>

The AUCs of artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine were lower with efavirenz, compared with when administered alone (decreases of 51%, 46% and 21% respectively). Day 7 lumefantrine levels, previously deemed predictive of treatment success, were 46% lower with efavirenz, but half-life was unchanged.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir Cmin by 42%, had no effect on AUC and increased Cmax by 17%, when compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily alone. This decrease in atazanavir Cmin might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. Coadministration of atazanavir and a higher dose of ritonavir (400/200 mg once daily) and efavirenz had no effect on AUC or Cmax and increased Cmin by 12% when compared to historical data from subjects receiving atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily alone. Co-administration of efavirenz with atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended. If the co-administration of atazanavir with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both atazanavir and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be considered with close clinical monitoring. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) to 27 subjects resulted in a 59% decrease in atazanavir Cmax, a 74% decrease in AUC and a 93% decrease in Cmin. A study in 13 patients showed that boosting atazanavir with ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with co-administered efavirenz (600 mg once daily) increased Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 14%, 39% and 48%, respectively, compared to unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) without efavirenz. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) had no effect on atazanavir AUC, increased atazanavir Cmax by 17% and decreased Cmin by 42% (n=14). When co-administered with efavirenz in treatment na&#239;ve patients, the recommended dose of atazanavir is 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg (together once daily with food) and efavirenz 600 mg (once daily on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime). Coadministration of efavirenz and atazanavir in treatment-experienced patients is not recommended. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Co-administration of efavirenz with atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended.

Based on historical comparison with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily in the evening) without efavirenz, coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (400/200 mg once daily in the evening) increased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 6%, 9% and 12%, respectively. The decrease in atazanavir Cmin might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir.

<p>&nbsp;</p><div>Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with  efavirenz. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) with  atazanavir (400 mg once daily), in 27 subjects, resulted in a 59%, 74%  and 93% decrease in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively.  Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) with  atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), in 13 subjects, caused a  14%, 39% and 48% increase in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin,  respectively. If atazanavir is combined with efavirenz in  treatment-na&#239;ve patients, atazanavir 400 mg (two 200-mg capsules) should  be administered with ritonavir 100 mg simultaneously once daily with  food, and efavirenz 600 mg should be administered on an empty stomach,  preferably at bedtime. Coadministration of atazanavir with efavirenz in  treatment-experienced patients is not recommended due to decreased  atazanavir exposure. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></div><em></em><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atazanavir trough concentrations (24 &#177; 4 h post dose) were determined in HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily n=12 or 400/100 once daily n=20) with an NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or atazanavir/ritonavir alone (300/100 mg once daily n=154). Coadministration of an NNRTI resulted in a 5.5-fold decrease in atazanavir trough concentrations; increasing the dose to 400/100 mg decreased the magnitude of the reduction to 1.7-fold, but did not overcome the inducer effect of the NNRTI on atazanavir metabolism. In the presence of an NNRTI, median (range) atazanavir troughs were 92 (24-415) ng/ml and 290 (71-2069) ng/ml for the 300/100 and 400/100 mg doses, respectively. Trough concentrations obtained in the absence of an NNRTI were 506 (26-2657) ng/ml. <br /><em>Critical drug interaction between ritonavir-boosted atazanavir regimen and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

<p>Comparison of switching from atazanavir alone (400 mg) to coadministration of 600 mg atazanavir and 600 mg efavirenz versus 300 mg atazanavir, 100 mg ritonavir and 600 mg efavirenz showed atazanavir AUC was decreased (21%) when given without ritonavir but maintained (increased 39%) when boosted with ritonavir. <br /><em>Atazanavir: A summary of two pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies in healthy subjects.

Efavirenz plasma concentration was 595 ng/ml compared to 1478 ng/ml prior to initiation of bexarotene.

An efavirenz plasma concentration was 595 ng/ml compared to 1478 ng/ml prior to initiation of bexarotene. Doubling the dose of efavirenz to 800 mg resulted in a therapeutic concentration (2230 ng/ml). Bexarotene plasma exposure was also decreased, with concentrations approximately 50% lower compared with steady-state reference pharmacokinetic data and consequently, only a partial efficacy of bexarotene on neoplastic lesions was observed.<br /><em>Deleterious pharmacokinetic interaction between bexarotene and efavirenz.

<div><br />Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and bupropion (150 mg single dose) was studied in 13 HIV- subject to assess the effect of efavirenz on CYP2B6 activity. Bupropion AUC and Cmax decreased by 55% and 34%, respectively. The AUC of a pharmacologically active metabolite, hydroxybupropion, was unchanged, but half life decreased from 24 h to 16 h. The 55% decrease in bupropion exposure may be clinically significant in patients on efavirenz taking bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation or as an antidepressant. <br /><em>Efavirenz induces CYP450 2B6 activity as measured by bupropion hydroxylation in healthy subjects. Robertson S, Maldarelli, Natarajan V, et al. 15th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Boston, February 2008, abstract 761.</em></div>
<p>Bupropion metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP2B6 and in vitro data has pointed to nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz being inhibitors of this enzyme. There is therefore potential for a drug interaction. This report is a case series aimed at documenting the clinical consequence of the co-administration of bupropion with nelfinavir, ritonavir, and efavirenz. The median duration of concomitant use was 8 months and ranged from 3 weeks to 2 years. There were no episodes of seizures documented in any of the medical records for patients who took bupropion with the CYP2B6 inhibitors. However, these data should be regarded as highly preliminary since: there is a low rate of seizure incidence in the literature, There were no PK measurements which are vital if we are to understand this interaction and no patients were receiving ritonavir at a dose above 100 mg bd. Further data are therefore required. <br /><em>Concurrent use of bupropion with CYP2B6 inhibitors, nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz: a case series. Park-Wyllie LY &amp; Antoniou T. AIDS, 2003, 17: 638-640. </em></p>
<p>The hydroxylation of bupropion was studied <em>in vitro</em> using human liver microsomes. It was concluded that ritonavir, efavirenz and nelfinavir inhibited CYP2B6 and therefore bupropion hydroxylation. The IC50 for efavirenz was 5.5 &#181;M. This suggests that there is the potential for clinical drug interactions. <br /><em>Ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro: Potential drug interactions with bupropion.

The steady-state AUC, Cmax and Cmin of the active carbamazepine epoxide metabolite remained unchanged. Coadministration of higher doses of either efavirenz or carbamazepine has not been studied. No dosage recommendation can be made. An alternative anticonvulsant should be considered. Carbamazepine plasma levels should be monitored periodically. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of carbamazepine (6 day dose escalation, then 400 mg once daily for 29 days) and efavirenz (600 mg for 14 days) to 12 subjects resulted in decreases in carbamazepine Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 20%, 27% and 35%, respectively. There was no change in Cmax or AUC of carbamazepine epoxide, but Cmin decreased by 13%. Data from 14 subjects receiving carbamazepine (6 day dose escalation, then 400 mg once daily for 15 days) and efavirenz (600 mg for 35 days) resulted in decreases in efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 21%, 36% and 47%, respectively. There are insufficient data to make a dosing recommendation for efavirenz, Alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be used. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and carbamazepine (1 week dose escalation from 200 mg once daily to 400 mg once daily) was studied in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic kinetic profiles were determined at steady state (full dose for 2 weeks). Data from 14 subjects showed that carbamazepine decreased efavirenz AUC (36%), Cmax (21%) and Cmin (47%). Similarly, data from 12 subjects showed that efavirenz decreased carbamazepine AUC (27%), Cmax (20%) and Cmin (35%). There are no data for this combination using higher doses of either drug; therefore, no dose recommendation can be made. Use of alternate anticonvulsants may be necessary for optimal antiretroviral / anticonvulsant therapy. The drugs were generally safe and well-tolerated when administered alone or in combination. <br /><em>A 2-way pharmacokinetic interaction between efavirenz and carbamazepine.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

<p>Decreased exposure of ciclosporin, tacrolimus or sirolimus may be expected due to CYP3A induction. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of antiretrovirals were studied in 17 HIV+ subjects pre transplant (without ciclosporin) and post transplant (with ciclosporin). Efavirenz AUCs (pre and post transplant) were near previously published values. Ciclosporin AUCs were generally lower in these patients (taking antiretrovirals) compared to HIV- transplant patients (historical data). Overtime the dose of ciclosporin and AUC remained essentially unchanged for patients on NNRTIs. <br /><em>Two-year evaluation of the interactions between antiretroviral medication and ciclosporine in HIV+ live and kidney transplant recipients.

<p>There is a case report of an apparent interaction between efavirenz and ciclosporin in an HIV-infected patient. The patient had received a kidney transplant in 1996 and been stabilised on ciclosporin achieving a plasma concentration of 328 ng/ml. HIV was diagnosed in 1999 and ZDV/3TC/EFV commenced. Ciclosporin levels began to decrease 5 days after EFV was added and reached a nadir of 50 ng/ml one month later (representing a 75% decrease from baseline). Close monitoring is recommended with appropriate dose adjustment of ciclosporin.<br /><em>Probable interaction between efavirenz and cyclosporine. Tseng A, Nguyen ME, Cardella C, et al.

<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but an interaction has been predicted based on metabolism, clearance, and/or available in vitro data. Clomipramine is metabolized by CYP3A4, 1A2 and 2C19 to desmethylclomipramine, an active metabolite which has a higher activity than the parent drug. In addition, clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine are metabolized by CYP2D6. Efavirenz could potentially decrease clomipramine concentrations but increase the formation of the active metabolite.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. These studies suggest that inducers of CYP3A4 (such as efavirenz) may increase metabolism of vitamin D and therefore reduce its effect. Various observational studies have reported increased risk for vitamin D deficiency in patients taking efavirenz containing regimens. However, no effect of efavirenz on the response to vitamin D supplementation was observed in a clinical study nor found in a PK modelling study.</span>

<p>Efavirenz in combination with darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily may result in sub-optimal darunavir Cmin. If efavirenz is to be used in combination with darunavir/ritonavir, the darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily regimen should be used. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (at a dose lower than recommended or with a different dosing regimen) increased efavirenz AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 21%, 15% and 17%, respectively. Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were decreased by 13%, 15% and 31%, respectively. Efavirenz decreases the plasma concentrations of darunavir as a result of CYP3A4 induction. Darunavir/ritonavir increases the plasma concentrations of efavirenz as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical monitoring for central nervous system toxicity associated with increased exposure to efavirenz may be indicated when darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir is given in combination with efavirenz. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>The interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and efavirenz was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Darunavir exposure decreased and efavirenz exposure increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 15%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 15%, 21% and 17%, respectively. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc,&nbsp;June 2012.</em></p>
<div>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on a once daily regimen of darunavir/ritonavir (900/100 mg) was investigated in 12 HIV- subjects. Coadministration decreased darunavir trough concentration by 57% (p&lt;0.001), AUC decreased by 14% (p=0.05) and Cmax decreased by 8% (p=0.23). Ritonavir trough concentrations and AUC were also significantly reduced by 54% and 26%, respectively. There was no significant effect on efavirenz trough concentrations (1% increase), AUC (9% decrease) or Cmax (20% decrease), but efavirenz half life was significantly increased by 66% in the combination phase. Although trough concentrations of darunavir were significantly reduced, all remained above the EC50 of wild-type virus. <br /><em><em>Pharmacokinetics of darunavir at 900 milligrams and ritonavir at 100 milligrams once daily when coadministered with efavirenz at 600 milligrams once daily in healthy volunteers.

<div>&nbsp;</div>The pharmacokinetic interaction between a non-licensed dose of darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg twice daily) was investigated in HIV-negative subjects. In the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz Cmin and Cmax increased by ~17% and AUC increased by 21%. Coadministration decreased darunavir Cmin by 31% and decreased AUC by 13%. Since the clinical significance of the changes in AUC and Cmin seen during coadministration has not been established, this combination should be used with caution.

                    <span><p>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p>
<p>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em></p>
<p>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

                    <span>In the gut, diloxanide furoate is largely, if not wholly, hydrolysed into diloxanide and furoic acid under the combined action of bacterial and gut esterases. After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response. Although the pharmacokinetic parameters of efavirenz were slightly increased (11-16%), these changes are not considered clinically significant and, thus, no dosage adjustment is necessary for efavirenz when administered with diltiazem. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of diltiazem (240 mg for 21 days) and efavirenz (600 mg for 14 days) was studied in 13 subjects. Coadministration resulted in decreases in diltiazem Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 60%, 69% and 63%, respectively. Reductions in Cmax, AUC and Cmin were also observed for the metabolites desacetyl diltiazem (64%, 75%, 62%, respectively) and N-monodesmethyl diltiazem (28%, 37%, 37%, respectively). Data from 12 subjects showed that efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 16%, 11% and 13%, respectively. Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the complete prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of efavirenz is necessary when administered with diltiazem. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and diltiazem (240 mg once daily) was studied in 25 HIV- subjects. Efavirenz significantly decreased diltiazem exposure by 60-69%. Concentrations of the two major metabolites of diltiazem decreased by 62-75% (desacetyl diltiazem) and 28-37% (N-monodesmethyl diltiazem). Efavirenz exposure was increased by 11-16%. No change in efavirenz dose is required; diltiazem dose adjustment should be guided by clinical response. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between efavirenz and diltiazem or itraconazole after multiple-dose administration in adult healthy subjects.

<p>Eflornithine was administered to six healthy men in single intravenous doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and oral doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 hr after oral doses.

Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight.

EFV  exposures were comparable to historical data. The lower EVG exposures  following switch from EFV/FTC/TDF to EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF are due to CYP3A  and UGT induction by EFV.

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

<p>Coadministration of an oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol/norgestimate 0.035/0.25 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 21 subjects for 14 days. There was no change in the Cmax, AUC or Cmin of ethinyestradiol. The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the active metabolites of norgestimate (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) decreased by 46%, 64% and 82% (norelgestromin) and by 80%, 83% and 86% (levonorgestrel, n=6)). No effect of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed.

<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of a tricyclic oral contraceptive containing ethinyestradiol and norgestimate was studied in 21 female HIV- subjects. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinylestradiol Cmax (6% increase) or AUC (10% decrease). Exposure to the active metabolites of norgestimate - norgestromin and levonorgestrel - were significantly decreased. The Cmax and AUC of norgestromin decreased by 46% and 74%, respectively, while the AUC of levonorgestrel decreased by 83% (n=6). Efavirenz pharmacokinetics were similar to historical data. Although there was no significant effect on the estrogen component, the significant decrease in the progestogen component reinforces the need for additional barrier contraception when taking oral contraceptives with efavirenz. <br /><em>Effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate in healthy female subjects.

<p>Coadministration of a single dose ethinylestradiol (50 &#181;g) with efavirenz (400 mg once daily) to 13 healthy volunteers resulted in a 37% increase in the AUC and a non-significant (8%) increase in Cmax of ethinylestradiol.

Metabolism is presumed to occur in the liver and 6 metabolites have been isolated: 2-ethylisonicotinamide, carbonyl-dihydropyridine, thiocarbonyl-dihydropyridine, S-oxocarbamoyl dihydropyridine, 2-ethylthioiso-nicotinamide, and ethionamide sulphoxide.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

Etravirine pharmacokinetics were assessed before and after efavirenz intake. Steady state etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly lower after efavirenz intake in the once daily and twice daily arms. Etravirine AUC, Cmax and Ctrough when given once daily decreased by 29%, 22% and 33%, respectively. When given twice daily, etravirine AUC, Cmax and Ctrough decreased by 28%, 21% and 37%, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/200 mg once daily for 2 weeks) to 16 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax, but decreases of 13% and 36% for AUC and Cmin.

Twice daily dosing of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg for 2 weeks) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 2 weeks) resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax and AUC, but a 17% in Cmin.

<p>Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of amprenavir. Appropriate doses of unboosted fosamprenavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. For fosamprenavir/ritonavir, an additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when efavirenz is administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily.

<p>Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) indicated no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction. No dosage adjustment is required for any of these medicinal products. The interaction between fosamprenavir, nelfinavir and efavirenz has not been studied but no dosage adjustment is required for any of these medicinal products. The interaction between fosamprenavir, saquinavir and efavirenz has not been studied, however, it is not recommended as the exposure of both PIs is expected to be significantly decreased.<br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Two prospective, open-label, non-randomized studies evaluated amprenavir and lopinavir steady-state pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients on a background of nucleosides and amprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (750/533/133 mg twice daily) with (n=7) or without (n=12) efavirenz (Study 1) and after switching from amprenavir to fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily, n=10; Study 2). Efavirenz did not significantly alter amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetic parameters in patients taking amprenavir/lopinavir. Amprenavir AUC was 28% lower in patients on efavirenz, but was not statistically significant (small sample size). Switching to fosamprenavir resulted in an increase in amprenavir Cmin, AUC, and Cmax without changing lopinavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics or overall tolerability. <br /><em>Amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetics following coadministration of amprenavir or fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir, with or without efavirenz.

However, virological failure developed and upon questioning it was found that the patient had been taking Gingko biloba for several months. Efavirenz concentrations were determined in stored plasma samples and showed decreasing concentrations which coincided with increasing viral load. The patient was successfully switched to alternative antiretrovirals. Although the exact mechanism of the interaction remains unresolved, the authors propose that Gingko biloba extract (principally the terpenoids) may lower efavirenz plasma levels by the induction of CYP3A4 and P-gp.</div><div><em>Interaction of Ginkgo biloba with efavirenz.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin but efavirenz is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). In vitro data indicate that efavirenz is a substrate and inhibitor of UGT2B7 and could potentially increase morphine concentrations via competition or inhibition of UGT2B7.

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of efavirenz via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both ifosfamide metabolites. induction of CYP2B enzymes by high-dose phenobarbital pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of ifosfamide undergoing 4-hydroxylation  from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. As efavirenz is an enzyme inducer, there is potential for ifosfamide levels to be reduced if coadministered.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>In an animal study in which rats were treated with ifosfamide alone or in conjunction with various P450 inducers and inhibitors, induction of liver P450 2B enzymes by 4-day high-dose phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of IF undergoing 4-hydroxylation&nbsp; from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. Pretreatment with the P450 3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both IF metabolites, without any net impact on the fraction of IF undergoing metabolic activation. These findings demonstrate specific roles for P450 2B and 3A enzymes in catalysing these pathways of IF metabolism in vivo. These studies also highlight several clinically relevant drug interactions that may occur during concomitant administration of IF with drugs and other compounds that modulate hepatic P450 enzyme levels.<br /><em>Modulation of P450-dependent ifosfamide pharmacokinetics: a better understanding of drug activation in vivo.

<div>Oral rifampicin given twice daily for 6 days, starting 3 days before intravenous ifosfamide (as a 24-hour infusion), increased the clearance of ifosfamide by over 100%; however, exposure to metabolites of ifosfamide was relatively unchanged.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. Efavirenz could potentially decrease imatinib exposure (induction of CYP3A4), potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. The US Prescribing Information suggests considering alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential when CYP3A4 inducers are indicated.

                    <span><p>Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity may significantly reduce exposure to imatinib, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Pre-treatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.<br /><em>Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.</em></p>
<p>Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of imatinib, increased imatinib oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased mean Cmax and AUC. Similar findings were observed in patients receiving 400-1200 mg/day imatinib concomitantly with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone). The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED&#8217;s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. Concomitant administration of imatinib and St. John&#8217;s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib. Consider alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential in patients when rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib doses up to 1200 mg/day (600 mg BID) have been given to patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.<br /><em>Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.</em></p></span>

<p>Adequate indinavir concentrations were described in 29-year old HIV+ Thai male receiving indinavir/ritonavir with efavirenz and rifampicin. Prior to the introduction of rifampicin-based TB therapy, the patient had been receiving indinavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). Indinavir trough and peakl plasma concentrations were 1.73 mg/L and 11.21 mg/L, respectively; efavirenz concentration determined mid-dose was 1.06 mg/L. Following the introduction of rifampicin, indinavir/ritonavir was maintained at 600/100 mg, giving indinavir trough and peak concentrations of 0.26 and 4.66 mg/L, respectively. Efavirenz was increased to 800 mg once daily, giving a mid-dose efavirenz concentration of 4.69 mg/L. After completion of TB therapy, the efavirenz dose was reduced to 600 mg. Although indinavir concentrations were significantly reduced, they were still compatible with clinical efficacy, as well as improved tolerability and safety. The reduction in indinavir concentrations was associated with improved renal function and the increased efavirenz dose was well tolerated. Indinavir has generally not been combined with rifampicin because of significant reductions in indinavir concentrations. However, it may be possible, especially with low body weight, to use indinavir at the usual dose (800/100 mg twice daily) in the presence of rifampicin and achieve a satisfactory therapeutic effect despite enzymic induction.<br /><em>Maintenance of successful ritonavir-boosted indinavir and efavirenz therapy in an HIV-infected patient with tuberculosis.

The twice daily indinavir regimen tended toward a higher Cmax and lower Cmin compared to those for indinavir 1000 mg three times daily.

<p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were evaluated in 20 HIV+ Thai subjects. Indinavir geometric mean (with 95% CI) AUC, Cmin and Cmax were 45.7 (39.8-52.5) mg/L.h, 0.32 ( 0.24-0.44) mg/L and 11.1 (9.4-13.0) mg/L respectively. A &gt;10-fold variation in Cmin was observed, but all were at least comparable to those obtained following indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone. Efavirenz geometric mean Cmin at 24 h was 2.1 mg/L (95% CI 1.6-2.6 mg/L) and was 30-35% higher than previously reported in healthy volunteers. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg in combination with efavirenz (600 mg) in HIV-1 infected subjects.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg bd) to 14 healthy volunteers resulted in significant decreases in indinavir AUC (-25%), Cmin (-50%) and Cmax (-17%). Cmin values were similar to those obtained with 800 mg indinavir given three times daily without ritonavir. Efavirenz concentrations were comparable to historical data. The dose of indinavir or ritonavir should be increased to maintain similar concentrations after the addition of efavirenz to a indinavir/ritonavir regimen. <br /><em>The influence of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of a twice daily combination of indinavir and low-dose ritonavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (200 mg once daily) and indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) resulted in a 31% decrease in indinavir AUC, a 16% decrease in indinavir Cmax and a 40% decrease in Ctrough. When efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and indinavir (1000 mg three times daily) were given to healthy volunteers, indinavir AUC and Ctrough decreased 33-46% and 39-57% respectively when compared to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Similar differences in indinavir AUC and Ctrough were also observed in HIV+ subjects. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of DMP 266 and indinavir multiple oral doses in HIV-1 infected individuals.

<p><strong>Efavirenz/Amprenavir and 2nd PI</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

<p>This case report details the interaction between itraconazole and efavirenz in a woman with disseminated histoplasmosis and HIV-1 infection. Previous data in healthy volunteers have shown a decrease of about 40% in exposure of itraconazole and its active metabolite (hydroxyitraconazole) and a recommendation to consider alternative antifungal treatment. Here the authors recommend that by the use of therapeutic drug monitoring of both efavirenz and itraconazole individual optimization of dosage can be made so that a change in therapy is not necessary. In this case the patient had a good clinical response and obtained therapeutic concentrations with a regimen including efavirenz 400 mg once daily and itraconazole 800 mg once daily. <br /><em>Therapeutic monitoring is necessary for the association itraconazole and efavirenz in a patient with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis.

The drug combination resulted in persistently elevated urinary Histoplasma antigen levels and subtherapeutic plasma itraconazole concentrations (&lt;0.05 &#181;g/ml).

No change in efavirenz dose is required; itraconazole dose recommendations are difficult due to lack of data with higher doses of itraconazole. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between efavirenz and diltiazem or itraconazole after multiple-dose administration in adult healthy subjects.

Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em></span>

<p>This Thai study investigated the effect of efavirenz on the ketoconazole pharmacokinetics in 12 HIV-infected patients. In phase one, patients received 400 mg of ketoconazole as a single oral dose on day 1; in phase two, they received 600 mg of efavirenz once daily in combination with 2 NRTIs on days 2 to 16. On day 16, a single 400 mg dose of ketoconazole was added to the regimen. Ketoconazole pharmacokinetics were studied on days 1 and 16. Ketoconazole Cmax and AUC were significantly decreased by 44% and 72%, respectively when given with efavirenz, indicating that efavirenz has a strong inducing effect on the metabolism of ketoconazole. <br><em>Effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole in HIV-infected patients.

<p>The effect of efavirenz- or nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) coadministration on levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics was studied in three groups of HIV-infected Ugandan women: ART-naive (n=17), efavirenz-based ART (n=20), and nevirapine-based ART (n=20). Levonorgestrel implants were inserted at baseline in all women. In one year of combined use, levonorgestrel exposure was markedly reduced in participants who received efavirenz-based ART, accompanied by contraceptive failures. In contrast, nevirapine-based ART did not adversely affect levonorgestrel exposure or efficacy. At week 24, levonorgestrel concentration were 47% lower in the efavirenz group, and 35% higher in the nevirapine group when compared to the ART-naive group (geometric mean levonorgestrel concentrations 528, 280, and 710 pg/ml in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively). At week 48, levonorgestrel concentration were 57% lower in the efavirenz group, and 14% higher in the nevirapine group when compared to the ART-naive group (levonorgestrel concentrations 580, 247, and 664 pg/mL in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively). Three pregnancies (3/20, 15%) occurred in the efavirenz group between weeks 36 and 48. No pregnancies occurred in the ART-naive or nevirapine groups.<br><em>Unintended pregnancies observed with combined use of the levonorgestrel contraceptive implant and efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy: a three-arm pharmacokinetic evaluation over 48 weeks.

<p>Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with efavirenz. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with efavirenz. The recommended dose of Kaletra tablets is 500/125 mg twice daily (such as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet). The recommended dose of Kaletra oral solution is 533/133 mg twice daily taken with food. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 500/125 (given as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in similar lopinavir concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg (given as two 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily without efavirenz. Increasing the dose of Kaletra tablets to 600/150 mg (given as three 200/50 mg tablets) twice daily coadministered with efavirenz resulted in significantly higher lopinavir plasma concentrations compared to Kaletra tablets 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg once daily for 9 days) to 11 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 3%, 19% and 39% respectively, when compared to data from 7 subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone. Efavirenz Cmax decreased by 9% and AUC and Cmin both decreased by 16% (compared to data from 12 subjects receiving efavirenz alone). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (500/125 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 19 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose increased lopinavir Cmax (12%) and AUC (6%), and decreased Cmin (10%). Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 9 days) and Kaletra tablets (600/150 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 23 HIV- subjects. When compared to values obtained with Kaletra tablets alone (400/100 mg twice daily), coadministration at the higher dose resulted in an increased lopinavir Cmax (36%), AUC (36%) and Cmin (32%). The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir are unaffected by concurrent efavirenz. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir capsules and efavirenz resulted in a substantial decrease in lopinavir exposure. With efavirenz, an increase of the lopinavir/ritonavir capsule or oral solution doses by 33% should be considered (4 capsules/~6.5 ml twice daily instead of 3 capsules/5 ml twice daily). Caution is warranted since this dosage adjustment might be insufficient in some patients. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased lopinavir concentrations by 30-40%. When lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (500/125 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were coadministered, lopinavir concentrations were similar to lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily without efavirenz. The dosage of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets should be increased to 500/125 mg twice daily when coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (400/100 mg every 12 hours) with efavirenz (600 mg), in 11 (efavirenz plus lopinavir/ritonavir) and 7 (lopinavir/ritonavir alone) subjects, resulted in no change in lopinavir Cmax, a 19% decrease in AUC and a 39% decrease in Cmin. Efavirenz AUC and Cmin both decreased by 16% but there was no alteration in Cmax. An increased dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (500/125 mg twice daily) was  coadmininistered with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) to 19 subjects for  10 days. When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone (400/100 mg twice  daily), lopinavir Cmax increased by 12%, ther was no change in AUC and Cmin decreased by 10%. A higher dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (600/150 mg twice daily) was coadmininistered with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) to 23 subjects for 10 days. When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone (400/100 mg twice daily), lopinavir AUC and Cmax both increased by 36% and Cmin increased by 32%. The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir were unaltered at all doses. <div>Dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended for all patients.

<p>Two prospective, open-label, non-randomized studies evaluated amprenavir and lopinavir steady-state pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients on a background of nucleosides and amprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (750/533/133 mg twice daily) with (n=7) or without (n=12) efavirenz (Study 1) and after switching from amprenavir to fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily, n=10; Study 2). Efavirenz did not significantly alter amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetic parameters in patients taking amprenavir/lopinavir. Switching to fosamprenavir resulted in an increase in amprenavir Cmin, AUC, and Cmax without changing lopinavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics or overall tolerability. <br /><em>Amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetics following coadministration of amprenavir or fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir, with or without efavirenz.

<p>A dose increase to 533/133 mg was advised when lopinavir/ritonavir capsules were coadministered with efavirenz. As this dose increase is not possible with the new tablet formulation (200/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir per tablet), the coadministration of 2 tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 21 HIV- subjects. Subjects received 3 lopinavir/ritonavir capsules (400/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) followed by 2 lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with efavirenz for 10 days. Lopinavir PK parameters were determined on days 10 (3 capsules alone) and 20 (2 tablets + EFV). Mean (&#177; sd) lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values on day 10 were 11.8&#177;3.3 &#181;g/ml, 95.7&#177;33.7 &#181;g.h/ml and 6.8&#177;3.3 &#181;g/ml, respectively. Cmax, AUC and Ctrough values obtained on day 20 were 10.5&#177;4.0 &#181;g/ml, 84.9&#177;17.8 &#181;g.h/ml and 5.0&#177;2.7 &#181;g/ml, respectively. Coadministration of efavirenz with the lopinavir/ritonavir tablet decreased lopinavir AUC and Ctrough by ~20% and 27%, respectively, compared to the capsule formulation administered alone. The concentrations obtained with the tablet + EFV were within the range of concentrations previously demonstrated to be efficacious in clinical trials. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir after multiple dose administration of lopinavir/ritonavir tablet coadministered with efavirenz.

<p>As the new lopinavir/ritonavir tablet is a fixed dose combination of 200/50 mg (the capsule dose is 133/33 mg), a dose increase to 533/133 mg when lopinavir/ritonavir is coadministered with efavirenz will not be possible. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (600/150 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily). When compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) given alone, lopinavir Cmax and AUC were moderately increased (36%); ritonavir Cmax increased 92% and ritonavir AUC increased 78%. The regimens were generally well tolerated. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic effect of efavirenz on a new tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; NVP n=9, EFV n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. <br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

<p>The coadministration of efavirenz with 2 NRTIs (n=19) or with 2 NRTIs plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100-532/132 mg twice daily, n=40) was studied in treatment experienced patients.

<p>The steady-state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 and 533/133 mg twice daily) when dosed in combination with efavirenz, plus two NRTIs, were assessed in 57 multiple PI-experienced but NNRTI-naive HIV+ subjects. When codosed with efavirenz, the 400/100 mg regimen resulted in lower lopinavir concentrations, (trough concentration = 3.66&#177;2.64 &#181;g/ml) than were observed in previous studies of lopinavir/ritonavir administered without efavirenz. Increasing the lopinavir/ritonavir dose to 533/133 mg increased lopinavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 46, 33, and 141%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values were increased by 48, 46 and 63%, respectively. The lopinavir trough concentration (5.88&#177;5.53 &#181;g/ml) achieved with the 533/133 mg dose was similar to historical data obtained with lopinavir/r 400/100 mg in the absence of efavirenz (5.49&#177;4.02 &#181;g/ml). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of lopinavir-ritonavir in combination with efavirenz and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in extensively pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

<p>The coadministration of efavirenz to 4 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in lopinavir Cmin values of 7625 (2870-11200) ng/ml and Cmax values of 14100 (3990-17300) ng/ml. Mean lopinavir concentrations in a group of patients (n=4) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone were 5690 (1420-11120) ng/ml for Cmin and 12400 (3920-17300) ng/ml for Cmax.

<p>An interaction study of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) and efavirenz was performed in healthy volunteers and HIV+ individuals all of whom received Kaletra (400 lopinavir/100 ritonavir mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). In healthy volunteers, efavirenz had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, with efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin being reduced by 16% or less in the presence of Kaletra. In healthy volunteers, efavirenz resulted in a 19% decrease in the AUC of lopinavir and a 39% decrease in the Cmin of lopinavir; there was no change in the Cmax of lopinavir. In HIV+ individuals, the decrease in lopinavir was 25% for AUC and 44% for Cmin. No dosage adjustment of efavirenz is required when administered with Kaletra. However, Kaletra should be increased by 33% from 400/100 mg to 533/133 mg when coadministered with efavirenz. <br /><em>Assessment of the pharmacokinetic interaction between ABT378/ritonavir and efavirenz in healthy volunteers and in healthy subjects.

<p><strong>Efavirenz and Lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir</strong></p>
<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir (533/133/750 mg twice daily) was investigated in 19 HIV-infected subjects. Subjects received lopinavir/ritonavir/amprenavir without (n=12) or with efavirenz (n=7). Lopinavir concentrations were similar to historical controls receiving lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily, while amprenavir concentrations were lower than those measured following the administration of amprenavir/ritonavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir in the absence of lopinavir, but similar to those observed in a previous pharmacokinetic study which investigated the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir/fosamprenavir 533/133/1400 mg twice daily. At the doses studied in this small pilot study, efavirenz did not seem to have any inducing effect on either lopinavir or amprenavir, since when comparing drug concentrations in the two groups of subjects, no significant different was observed. However, a wider inter-individual variability in both lopinavir and amprenavir concentrations was observed in the efavirenz group. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of amprenavir, lopinavir, and efavirenz concentrations in HIV-infected patients.

Coadministration of artemether/lumefantrine (80/480 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Coadministration decreased the Cmax and AUC of artemether by 21% and 51% and those of dihydroartemisinin by 38% and 46%. Lumefantrine AUC decreased by 21% but there was no change in Cmax. Efavirenz AUC decreased by 17%, with no change in Cmax. Artemether/lumefantrine should be used cautiously with efavirenz because decreased artemether, dihydroartemisinin (active metabolite of artemether), and/or lumefantrine concentrations may result in a decrease of antimalarial efficacy of artemether/lumefantrine.<br />

<div>The pharmacokinetics of artemether, DHA, lumefantrine and efavirenz were determined in 12 HIV- negative and malaria-uninfected subjects who received artemether/lumefantrine (80/480 mg twice daily) for 3 days before and during efavirenz co-administration (600 mg daily for 26 days). The AUCs of artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine were lower with efavirenz, compared with when administered alone (decreases of 51%, 46% and 21% respectively). Day 7 lumefantrine levels, previously deemed predictive of treatment success, were 46% lower with efavirenz, but half-life was unchanged. Efavirenz AUC decreased by 17% after artemether/lumefantrine co-administration. The authors suggest that the observed modest changes probably do not warrant dosage adjustment during co-administration.</div>

                    <span><p>In a 3-month drug interaction study, no significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetic parameters were found between subjects receiving efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy and subjects receiving no antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were found by other investigators, although the MPA plasma levels were more variable in the second study. In both studies, plasma progesterone levels for subjects receiving efavirenz and DMPA remained low consistent with suppression of ovulation. Because of the limited information available, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of medroxyprogesterone (IM depot injection) were studied in 15 HIV+ women receiving zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz. When compared to data obtained from 15 HIV+ women not receiving antiretroviral therapy, there were no differences in medroxyprogesterone AUC, Cmin, half life or clearance. Side effects related to medroxyprogesterone were not increased. Thus, it is likely that this combination regimen would not decrease medroxyprogesterone&#8217;s contraceptive effectiveness. The effect on medroxyprogesterone on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine, lamivudine or efavirenz was not assessed. <br /><em>Nanda K, Amaral E, Hays M, et al.

<p>The interaction between efavirenz and MPA (given intramuscularly as DMPA) was evaluated in 17 HIV+ women. When compared to a control group of subjects (n=16), there were no significant changes in the Cmin or AUC of MPA when given with efavirenz, with suppression of ovulation being maintained. The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz were determined prior to and 4 weeks after DMPA administration. There were no significant changes in efavirenz exposure (4% decrease in AUC, 12% decrease in Cmax, 6% increase in Cmin). <br /><em>Depo-medroxyprogesterone in women on antiretroviral therapy: effective contraception and lack of clinically significant interactions.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) with methadone (35-100 mg once daily, stable maintenance doses)decreased methadone AUC and Cmax by 52% and 45%, respectively. In a study of HIV-infected IV drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with methadone resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. The methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg daily for 14-21 days) to 11 subjects stable on methadone maintenance (35-100 mg daily) resulted in a 45% decrease in methadone Cmax, a 52% decrease in AUC and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>There is case study of 3 HIV-infected patients who were stable under methadone maintenance treatment, but who started to complain of opioid abstinence 3-7 days after the introduction of efavirenz to their antiretroviral regimen. Increases in methadone dosage of 66-133% were required before a subjective state of compensation was regained. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed in one patient and revealed a 70% decrease in plasma methadone concentrations; this was eventually compensated for by a 133% increase in methadone dose. Efavirenz concentrations were comparable to historical data.<br /><em>Undefined duration of opiate withdrawal induced by efavirenz in drug users with HIV infection and undergoing chronic methadone treatment.

<p>Administration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) to 11 HIV+ individuals who were receiving methadone resulted in a significant reduction in methadone AUC 0&#8211;24 h (5309 vs 12341 ng/ml.h; alone vs with efavirenz). There was a marked decrease in methadone Cmax in presence of efavirenz (358 vs 689 ng/ml; alone vs with efavirenz). 9/11 patients described symptoms of methadone withdrawal and received a dose increase (mean 22% increase). <br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of methadone in HIV-positive patients receiving the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline.

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

A 21% and 20% increase in nelfinavir Cmax and AUC, respectively, was observed with no change in Cmin. The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the metabolite AG-1402 (M8) was decreased by 40%, 37% and 43%, respectively. Efavirenz Cmax and AUC both decreased by 12% and Cmin decreased by 21%.

<p>Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from HIV+ patients receiving nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) alone and in combination, 4 and 32 weeks of therapy. Data from 36 profiles of nelfinavir alone and 37 profiles of nelfinavir + efavirenz showed that efavirenz reduced nelfinavir AUC by 25% (from 30.5 to 22.8 &#181;h.h/ml) and reduced Cmin by 45% (from 1.1 to 0.6 &#181;g/ml); there was no significant effect on Cmax (4.3 vs 3.7 &#181;g/ml).

<p>The effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir and M8 was investigated in HIV+ subjects using full PK profiles (n=49) or single samples (n=552).

Nelfinavir CL/F was significantly higher with coadministration of efavirenz (19% and 9%, higher, profiles and single samples respectively); M8 CL/F was higher by 43% and 77% (profiles and single samples respectively). These results indicating increased nelfinavir and M8 clearance in the presence of efavirenz contradict prior data reported in healthy subjects. <br /><em>Effect of co-administration of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir and its active metabolite, M8, in ACTG 384.

<p>A pharmacokinetic study in 18 HIV+ individuals who were receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily), nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 h) and stavudine showed that nelfinavir concentrations were consistent with those achieved without efavirenz. The authors conclude that no <em>a priorii</em> dose adjustment is required when nelfinavir is coadministered with efavirenz, however in 4/18 patients nelfinavir concentrations were below the MEC (400 ng/ml) and a strategy of adjusting nelfinavir dosage based on measurements of total body systemic exposure should be further evaluated. <br /><em>Clinical pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir combined with efavirenz and stavudine during rescue treatment of heavily pretreated HIV-infected patients.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 h) resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC of nelfinavir and a 37% decrease in the AUC of the nelfinavir metabolite. There was a 21% increase in the Cmax of nelfinavir and a 40% decrease in the Cmax of the nelfinavir metabolite. Nelfinavir did not significantly alter the AUC or Cmax of efavirenz. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between efavirenz and nelfinavir mesylate in healthy volunteers.

<p><strong>Efavirenz/Amprenavir and 2nd PI</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

<p><strong>Efavirenz + Nelfinavir/Ritonavir (once daily)</strong></p>
<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on nelfinavir/ritonavir (1875/200 mg once daily) was studied in 24 healthy subjects. Following the addition of efavirenz, nelfinavir geometric mean AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 30%, 29% and 48% respectively. Nelfinavir Cmin increased in 21/24 subjects and decreased in 3/24 subjects. Ritonavir geometric mean AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 20%, 24% and 12% respectively.

<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min.

<p>A 51-year-old man with HIV infection who was receiving extended-release nifedipine (60 mg/day) developed symptomatic orthostasis and heart block after starting antiretroviral therapy that included nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily). Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms. Drug therapy at that time consisted of nifedipine (60 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), losartan (50 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and abacavir (300 mg twice daily). Discontinuation of atenolol, and nifedipine dosage reduction to 30 mg/day were effective in managing his orthostatic changes.<br /><em>Symptomatic Orthostasis With Extended-Release Nifedipine and Protease Inhibitors.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

There was no change in the Cmax, AUC or Cmin of ethinyestradiol.

<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of a tricyclic oral contraceptive containing ethinyestradiol and norgestimate was studied in 21 female HIV- subjects. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinylestradiol Cmax (6% increase) or AUC (10% decrease). Exposure to the active metabolites of norgestimate - norgestromin and levonorgestrel - were significantly decreased. The Cmax and AUC of norgestromin decreased by 46% and 74%, respectively, while the AUC of levonorgestrel decreased by 83% (n=6). Efavirenz pharmacokinetics were similar to historical data. Although there was no significant effect on the estrogen component, the significant decrease in the progestogen component reinforces the need for additional barrier contraception when taking oral contraceptives with efavirenz. <br /><em>Effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate in healthy female subjects.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

<p>Oxytocin has a plasma half-life of about 1 to 6 minutes which is decreased in late pregnancy and during lactation. Following intravenous administration of oxytocin, uterine response occurs almost immediately and subsides within 1 hour. Following intramuscular injection of the drug, uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes and persists for 2 to 3 hours. Its rapid removal from plasma is accomplished largely by the kidney and the liver.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>Efavirenz and phenytoin concentrations were determined in a 35 year old HIV+ patient who commenced efavirenz (800 mg once daily) and emtricitabine/tenofovir (200/300 mg once daily). Prior to the initiation of HAART, the patient had achieved therapeutic phenytoin concentrations at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. Following the introduction of HAART, phenytoin was switched to 400 mg once daily (for 5 days) but, following subtherapeutic concentrations, was then increased to 400 mg twice daily. After 14 days of HAART, phenytoin was reduced to 200 mg twice daily. Efavirenz concentrations were measured at days 5 and 15, but were undetectable (&lt;0.05 &#181;g/ml). Efavirenz was increased to 600 mg twice daily on day 20 and phenytoin stopped for levetiracetam and lamotrigine. Efavirenz concentrations were determined at day 34 and were 3.6 &#181;g/ml. Efavirenz was subsequently reduced to 600 mg once daily, but concentrations at this dose are not given in the report. During treatment his HIV viral load decreased from a baseline of &gt;1 million copies/ml to 12400 copies/ml on day 14 and further decreased to 921 copies/ml by day 30. <br /><em>Clinical interaction between efavirenz and phenytoin.

<p>A bidirectional drug interaction between efavirenz and phenytoin has been reported in a case study of a 39 year old Ethiopian man with toxoplasmic encephalitis who had been stable on phenytoin (300 mg twice daily). Approximately 1 week after initiation of efavirenz (600 mg once daily), a 12 h post dose sample gave an efavirenz concentration of 340 ng/ml which was below the target of 1000 ng/ml. It was decided to rapidly taper the phenytoin dosage, to switch to levetiracetam, and to increase efavirenz to 800 mg once daily. Prior to the efavirenz dose increase, a further 12 h sample was obtained (~18 days after initiation of efavirenz); this was 580 ng/ml and again was below target. A sample obtained ~14 days after the last dose of phenytoin and whilst receiving levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (800 mg once daily) showed an efavirenz concentration of 2500 ng/ml. Efavirenz dosage was reduced to 600 mg once daily; a sample collected 3 weeks after dose reduction showed a concentration of 1960 ng/ml. Phenytoin concentrations were measured whilst receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and showed a gradual increase over ~3 weeks from ~11 &#181;g/ml to 23.5 &#181;g/ml (therapeutic range 10-20 &#181;g/ml). Until more data become available, both phenytoin and efavirenz levels should be monitored closely when the drugs are given concurrently to avoid potential toxicity or treatment failure. <br /><em>A potentially significant interaction between efavirenz and phenytoin: a case report and review of the literature.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Coadministration of atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg single dose) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) decreased proguanil AUC by 44% but there was no change in Cmax. Atovaquone AUC and Cmax decreased by 75% and 44%.The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 by efavirenz. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Concomitant administration of atovaquone/proguanil with efavirenz should be avoided whenever possible. If judged clinically necessary, consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

                    <span>Pyridostigmine bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterases and is also metabolised in the liver. Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Efavirenz reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir. The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and raltegravir (400 mg single dose) decreased raltegravir Cmax by 36%, AUC by 36% and Cmin by 21% (n=9).<br />

<em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Based on the results of drug interaction studies, no dosage adjustment is recommended when efavirenz is given with raltegravir. Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg single dose) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was studied in 9 subjects. Raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 36%, 36% and 21%, respectively.<br />
<em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>The potential effect of efavirenz on raltegravir pharmacokinetics was examined in healthy subjects administered raltegravir alone (400 mg single dose), followed by efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 14 days with a single dose of raltegravir (400 mg) on day 12. In the presence of efavirenz, raltegravir pharmacokinetics were moderately to weakly reduced: GMR (90% CI) for C12h, AUC and Cmax were 0.79 (0.49, 1.28), 0.64 (0.52, 0.80) and 0.64 (0.41, 0.98), respectively. Though plasma concentrations of raltegravir were reduced by efavirenz, the degree of this reduction was not considered to be clinically meaningful and no dose adjustment is required.<br /><em>Minimal effects of ritonavir and efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

<p>The effect of an increase in rifabutin dose (from 300 to 600 mg twice weekly) after initiation of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was investigated in 15 HIV/TB coinfected patients. The geometric mean rifabutin AUC following a 300 mg dose was 4.15 &#181;g/ml.h and increased to 4.98 &#181;g/ml.h when the dose was increased in the presence of efavirenz. Cmax was significantly higher following dose increase with efavirenz initiation (0.6 vs 0.4 &#181;g/ml). Efavirenz AUC, Cmax and Cmin obtained with 600 mg rifabutin (203 &#181;mol/L.h, 14.1 &#181;mol/L, 6.0 &#181;mol/L, respectively) were comparable to those obtained in HIV+ historical control subjects (184 &#181;mol/L.h, 12.9 &#181;mol/L, 5.6 &#181;mol/L, respectively; n=35). Efavirenz trough concentrations were below target (3.5 &#181;mol/L) in only 1/15 patients. The increase in rifabutin from 300 mg to 600 mg was adequate to compensate for the drug interaction with efavirenz in most patients. The standard efavirenz dosage of 600 mg once daily achieved adequate plasma concentrations during intermittent rifabutin therapy and was generally well tolerated. However, additional studies are needed to characterise optimal treatment regimens. <br /><em>Evaluation of the drug interaction between rifabutin and efavirenz in patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis.

The current American guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents recommend to maintain efavirenz at 600 mg once daily in the presence of rifampicin and to monitor virologic response and efavirenz concentrations (although mention is made that some clinicians suggest efavirenz 800 mg dose in patients weighing more than 60 kg). The British HIV Association guidelines recommend that efavirenz is used at 600 mg once daily irrespective of bodyweight during concomitant rifampicin therapy. We recommend using efavirenz at 600 mg once daily in the presence of rifampicin. In the absence of efficacy data, patients maintained on efavirenz 400 mg once daily (following the results of the ENCORE clinical trial) should increase to efavirenz 600 mg once daily while treated with rifampicin.</p></span>

<p>In a study of 20 HIV infected and 33 TB-HIV co-infected Ethiopian patients, both treatment groups underwent PK sampling following an oral 600 mg EFV dose at week 16 of initiating EFV based combination antiretroviral therapy. The TB-HIV co-infected group repeated the PK 8 weeks after stopping RIF-based anti-TB treatment. Between treatment group analysis indicated no significant effect of RIF based anti-TB treatment on PK exposure parameters of EFV, nor was there a significant effect after controlling for sex or CYP2B6 genotype. However, RIF based therapy in TB-HIV co-infected patients had significantly increased 8-OH-EFV PK exposure measures and metabolic ratio relative to HIV only patients, AUC greater by 79%. The effect was more prominent in females and CYP2B6*6 carriers in within sex and CYP2B6 genotype comparisons. Within-subject comparisons for AUC and Cmax when "on" and "off" RIF based anti-TB co-treatment showed geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of 100.5% (98.7-102.3) and 100.2% (98.1-102.4), respectively for EFV, and 98.6% (95.5-101.7), and 97.6% (92.2-103.0), respectively for 8-OH-EFV. The authors called for caution related to higher exposure to 8-OH-EFV during simultaneous coadministration of EFV and RIF based anti-TB regimens, which may be associated with neurotoxicity, particularly in females, and CYP2B6*6 carriers. &nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Long-term effect of rifampicin-based anti-TB regimen co-administration on the pharmacokinetic parameters of efavirenz and 8-hydroxy-efavirenz in HIV infected and TB-HIV co-infected Ethiopian patients.

<p>During TB treatment, EFV was dosed at 600 mg in patients &lt;50 kg or 800 mg if ≥50 kg; off TB treatment it was dosed at 600 mg. Polymorphisms in CYP2B6, CYP2A6 and UGT2B7 enzymes were sequenced. During TB treatment, median EFV Cmin was 3.2 (IQR 2.6-6.3) µg/ml and 3.3 (2.4-9.5) µg/ml in the 800 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively. After TB treatment EFV Cmin was 2.0 (1.4-3.5) µg/ml. Minor allele frequencies for CYP2B6 516G&gt;T, 785A&gt;G, 983T&gt;C, UGT2B7-372G&gt;A, CYP2A6*9B and CYP2A6*17 were 0.31, 0.33, 0.23, 0.29, 0.10 and 0.02, respectively. Haplotypes CYP2B6*6 and CYP2B6*18 were found in 38.9% and 25.9% of patients, respectively. Polymorphisms in all three CYP2B6 genes studied (516T-785G-983C) were present in 11.1% of patients and in this group median EFV Cmin was 19.2 (IQR 9.5-20) µg/ml during and 4.7 (IQR 3.5-5.6) µg/ml after TB treatment. The presence of TB treatment and composite genotypes CYP2B6 516 GT/TT, CYP2B6 983 TC/CC and CYP2A6*9B carrier status predicted median EFV Cmin &gt;4 µg/ml. Adverse events due to high EFV concentrations were rare. Because polymorphisms of EFV metabolizing enzymes are frequent and are associated with elevated EFV concentrations in this population, EFV dose increases are unnecessary when concomitant rifampicin-containing TB treatment is prescribed.<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Efavirenz dosing: influence of drug metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms and concurrent tuberculosis treatment.

<p>HIV-infected patients, who had received combination antiretroviral therapy containing efavirenz (600 mg daily) for two weeks or greater, including 18 with TB, were enrolled; 113 (66.1%) with CYP2B6 G516G, 55 (32.2%) GT, and 3 (1.8%) TT genotype. Patients receiving rifampicin had a significantly lower median plasma efavirenz concentration than the control group (2.16 vs 2.92 mg/L, P = 0.003); however, all patients achieved target plasma concentration (&gt;1 mg/L). Patients with GT or TT genotype had a significantly higher plasma concentration than those with GG genotype (2.50 vs 3.47 mg/L for GT genotype and 8.78 mg/L for TT genotype, P&lt;0.001). Plasma efavirenz concentration &gt;4 mg/L was noted in 38 (22.2%) patients, which was associated with a lower weight (per 10-kg increase, odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.83) and GT or TT genotype (odds ratio, 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-9.59) in multivariate analysis. Despite combination with rifampicin, sufficient plasma efavirenz concentrations can be achieved in HIV-infected Taiwanese with TB who receive efavirenz 600 mg daily.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetics study of HIV-infected ethnic Chinese receiving efavirenz-containin antiretroviral therapy with or without rifampicin-based anti-tuberculosis therapy.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg/day) and rifampicin (600 mg/day) was studied in 11 healthy subjects. The median interquartile range, rifampicin Cmax, AUC, and weight-normalized clearance were 8.9 (7.3-13.8) μg/ml, 48.8 (29.6-67.4) μg.h/ml, and 0.19 (0.11-0.29) L/h/kg, respectively. Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) c.388A&gt;G and SLCO1B1 c.463C.&gt;A polymorphisms jointly had significant effect on rifampin Cmax (R2=0.75). Male sex and SLCO1B1 c.463C&gt;A polymorphism together influenced rifampicin AUC (R2=0.52) and weight-normalized clearance (R2=0.65). All four volunteers with rifampicin Cmax &lt;8 μg/ml (lower end of the normal range) had c.463CA genotype. Rifampicin Cmax and AUC had no significant relationship with the efavirenz AUC ratio or weight-normalized clearance ratio in the presence versus absence of rifampin (p&gt;0.05). Men with the SLCO1B1c.463CA genotype are at increased risk of lower rifampin plasma exposure. However, plasma rifampin concentrations did not correlate with the extent of induction of efavirenz clearance by rifampin during coadministration.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Factors associated with variability in rifampin plasma pharmacokinetics and the relationship between rifampin concentrations and induction of efavirenz clearance.

<p>Concomitant antituberculosis treatment increased efavirenz concentrations 1.49-fold (95% CI 1.10–2.01) in children with slow metabolizer genotypes, but did not affect efavirenz concentrations in extensive or intermediate metabolizer genotypes. After adjustment for dose/kg, each kilogram of weight was associated with a 2.8% (95% CI 0.9–4.7) decrease in efavirenz concentrations. Despite higher mg/kg doses, a higher proportion of children in the lowest weight band (10–13.9 kg) had efavirenz concentrations less than 1.0 mg/L than larger children. Antituberculosis treatment was not associated with reduced efavirenz concentrations in children, which does not support increased efavirenz doses. Children with slow metabolizer genotype have increased efavirenz concentrations during antituberculosis treatment, likely due to isoniazid inhibiting enzymes involved in accessory metabolic pathways for efavirenz.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Effects of rifampin-based antitiberculosis therapy on plasma efavirenz concentrations in children vary by CYP2B6 genotype.

<p>In Cambodian patients, efavirenz (600 mg/day) and stavudine plus lamivudine were administered in addition to standard antituberculosis treatment, including rifampicin and isoniazid. Change in efavirenz apparent clearance in patients taking both efavirenz and antituberculosis treatment was highly dependent on NAT2 polymorphism, as a possible surrogate of isoniazid exposure. Patients carrying the CYP2B6 516 TT genotype and slow-acetylation NAT2 phenotype had the lowest efavirenz apparent clearance. These data suggest that the inducing effect of rifampicin is counterbalanced by a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of isoniazid on efavirenz clearance.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Dependence of efavirenz- and rifampicin-isoniazid-based antituberculosis treatment drug-drug interaction on CYP2B6 and NAT2 genetic polymorphisms: ANRS 12154 study in Cambodia.

<p>Efavirenz Cmin concentrations were determined in 780 patients, with 543 providing at least one Cmin sample. Median weight was 52.8 kg (IQR, 48.0-59.5), body mass index 19.4 kg/m2 (IQR, 17.5-21.6), and age 34 years (IQR, 29-41); 63% were male, 74% black. Median Cmin was 1.96 µg/mL with rifampicin versus 1.80 without rifampicin (P=0.067). Cmin were significantly higher with rifampicin versus without rifampicin in blacks (2.08 vs 1.75, P=0.005). Weight ≥60 kg with rifampicin, compared to &lt;60 kg, was associated with lower EFV Cmin (1.68 vs 2.02, P=0.021). However, weight ≥60 kg was associated with more frequent HIV RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at week 48, compared to weight &lt;60 kg (81.9% vs 73.8%, P=0.023). Efavirenz and rifampicin-based tuberculosis therapy coadministration was associated with a trend toward higher, not lower, efavirenz Cmin compared to efavirenz alone. Patients weighing ≥60 kg had lower median efavirenz Cmin versus those &lt;60 kg, but there was no association of higher weight with reduced virologic suppression.

<p>Plasma concentrations of efavirenz with a 600 mg standard dose in Cambodian HIV-infected adults treated for tuberculosis with a body weight above 50 kg was evaluated. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were higher in 332 patients who weighed &lt;50 kg compared with 150 who weighed ≥50 kg (median [IQR] 2,859 [1,787-4,749] and 2,060 [1,425-3,575] ng/ml, respectively; P=0.02). However, the proportion of patients with efavirenz concentrations below 1000 ng/ml was not different between those weighing less than or more than 50 kg (6% and 10%, respectively; P=0.13) and a body weight above 50 kg was not associated with a higher risk of plasma efavirenz concentrations below 1000 ng/ml. When plasma efavirenz concentrations below 1000 ng/ml were present, they were not associated with virological failure.

<p>Efavirenz concentrations were determined in TB/HIV-coinfected Tanzanian patients. TB treatment (rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide/ethambutol) was from week 1 to week 8 and continued with rifampicin and isoniazid for another 16 weeks. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) of efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine was started at week 4 after initiation of TB treatment. A total of 25 patients (56% male) completed the study; 21 had evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles. AUCs of efavirenz, tenofovir and emtricitabine were slightly higher when these drugs were coadministered with TB drugs; geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 1.08 (0.90, 1.30), 1.13 (0.93, 1.38) and 1.05 (0.85, 1.29), respectively. For TB drugs, equivalence was suggested for peak plasma concentrations when administered with and without efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine. Adverse events were mostly mild and no serious adverse events or drug discontinuations were reported.

Steady-state EFV plasma concentrations (n=209 samples) were measured, 83 in the presence of rifampicin. Apparent EFV clearance after oral administration in fast metabolizers was 12.9 L/h/70 kg whilst off tuberculosis treatment and 9.1 L/h/70 kg when on tuberculosis treatment. In slow metabolizers, the clearance estimates were 3.3 and 4.7 L/h/70 kg in the presence and absence of TB treatment, respectively. Overall there was a 29.5% reduction in EFV clearance during tuberculosis treatment.

<p>Individuals from the CIPRA-South Africa cohort taking EFV-based antiretroviral therapy with concomitant tuberculosis (TB) were dosed with either increased (800 mg) or standard (600 mg) dose EFV during TB treatment. After TB therapy, all individuals took 600 mg EFV. Two mid-dosing interval EFV concentrations were determined from each individual: after 4 weeks of concomitant EFV and RFN therapy, and ≥4 weeks after TB therapy completion. Paired samples were collected from 72 individuals. Overall, 45 (63%) were women and median weight was 59 kg (IQR 52-67). A total of 38 (53%) individuals took 800 mg EFV during TB treatment and 34 (47%) took 600 mg. EFV concentrations in the 800 mg group were higher with RFN (2.9 mg/L [IQR 1.8-5.6]) than without (2.1 mg/L [IQR 1.4-3.0]; P=0.0003). There was no significant difference in EFV concentrations with RFN (2.4 mg/L [IQR 1.2-5.1]) or without (2.2 mg/L [IQR 1.4-3.7]) in the 600 mg group.

Although an efavirenz dose increase to 800 mg appears not to be required for Thai patients (body weight ~50 kg) receiving rifampicin, these results may not be applicable to other populations with higher body weights. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Efavirenz 600 mg/day versus efavirenz 800 mg/day in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis and receiving rifampicin: 48 weeks results.

<p>A retrospective observational survey of a clinical TDM service was performed to assess the impact of rifampicin on EFV plasma concentrations following 600 mg or 800 mg once daily. Plasma concentrations (1-24 h post dose, n=28) were available from 16 HIV+ patients receiving rifampicin and EFV; 11 were receiving EFV 800 mg and 5 EFV 600 mg. Median (range) EFV concentrations were 3.9 (1.3-10.9) mg/L in the 600 mg group and 2.9 (1.0-13.5) mg/L respectively. None of the EFV concentrations was subtherapeutic. Concentrations were above the therapeutic range in 5/11 patients on EFV 800 mg resulting in a dose decrease to 600 mg in 4 of these patients. No significant correlation was observed between age, weight or EFV dose and having high EFV concentrations. This small study suggests that EFV dosed at 600 mg with rifampicin does not result in subtherapeutic concentrations and, in contrast, EFV 800 mg lead to high EFV concentrations in almost half of the patients. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Efavirenz 600 mg is not associated with subtherapeutic EFV concentrations when given concomitantly with rifampin.

<p>A case series was described of 8 HIV+ patients (6 female, 2 male) who developed significant toxicity while taking efavirenz (800 mg once daily) and rifampicin. Efavirenz trough concentrations were high in all patients (median 10551 ng/ml, range 5201-19591 ng/ml; upper target 4000 ng/ml). Significant CNS side effects developed in 7 patients, and one developed efavirenz-induced hepatitis. All but the patient who developed hepatitis were of black ethnicity. Efavirenz was discontinued in 3 patients and reduced to 400-600 mg in 4 patients (who then achieved viral suppression at &lt;50 copies/ml); one patient died of TB-related complications. The authors comment that the use of efavirenz at high dose in patients taking rifampicin can not be universally endorsed and that TDM may have a useful role in minimising serious side effects. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">High dose efavirenz with rifampicin for HIV infected patients with concomitant tuberculosis: one size does not fit all.

<p>Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg), isoniazid (400 mg) and pyrazinamide (2 g) with 2 NRTIs and efavirenz (600 mg/day) was investigated in 49 HIV and TB coinfected patients. There was good control of both HIV and TB. The authors concluded increasing the daily dose of efavirenz to 800 mg is not necessary and may increase side effects. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Efficacy and safety of efavirenz in HIV patients on rifampicin for tuberculosis.

<p>In a study of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and rifampicin (600-720 mg, weight adjusted) in 8 HIV+ individuals, rifampicin was found to reduce efavirenz pharmacokinetics by ~20%. Increasing the dose of efavirenz to 800 mg resulted in similar efavirenz exposure as achieved with 600 mg alone. The pharmacokinetics of rifampicin did not change substantially in the presence of efavirenz.<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Pharmacokinetic interactions between efavirenz and rifampicin in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis.

<p>Data from 12 healthy volunteers who received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and rifampicin (600 mg once daily) were compared with historical controls. The results suggest that rifampicin metabolism is not appreciably affected by EFV. Efavirenz metabolism was induced in 10 out of 12 subjects studied. An increase in EFV dose may be considered when coadministered with rifampicin, however, at present there are inadequate safety data to recommend an EFV dose higher than 600 mg daily. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Pharmacokinetic interaction between efavirenz and rifampicin healthy volunteers.

Efavirenz AUC, Cmax, and Cmin increased by 21%, 14%, and 25%, respectively. When efavirenz was given with ritonavir 500 mg or 600 mg twice daily, the combination was not well tolerated (for example, dizziness, nausea, paraesthesia and elevated liver enzymes occurred). Sufficient data on the tolerability of efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir (100 mg, once or twice daily) are not available. When using efavirenz with low-dose ritonavir, the possibility of an increase in the incidence of efavirenz-associated adverse events should be considered, due to possible pharmacodynamic interaction. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours) with efavirenz (600 mg) to 11 subjects resulted in increases in ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 24%, 18% and 42%, respectively, following the morning dose; following the evening dose, there was no change in ritonavir Cmax or AUC, but a 24% increase in Cmin. Ritonavir caused increases in efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 14%, 21% and 25%, respectively. Combining efavirenz with ritonavir was associated with higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when efavirenz is used in combination with ritonavir. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) increased efavirenz AUC by 21% and ritonavir AUC by 17%. A higher frequency of adverse events (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paraesthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes) have been observed when efavirenz is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of low dose ritonavir (100 mg) on efavirenz concentrations was assessed in a group of patients taking a ritonavir-boosted PIs with efavirenz (600 mg) and compared those taking 2 NRTIs with efavirenz. Efavirenz concentrations were about 40% greater in patients taking a ritonavir-boosted PI but efavirenz Ctrough were within the therapeutic range in 90% patients. <br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of efavirenz in HIV-infected patients treated by Sustiva associated or not with ritonavir.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and ritonavir (500 mg every 12 h) has shown that efavirenz inhibited the metabolism of ritonavir. This resulted in a 18% increase in ritonavir AUC and 24% increase in ritonavir Cmax after the morning dose of ritonavir. There was no change in AUC or Cmax after the evening dose. Efavirenz AUC increased by 21% and Cmax increased by 14% in the presence of ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz and ritonavir after multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.

<p><strong>Ritonavir (400 mg) + Saquinavir</strong></p>
<p>The effect of adding efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg bd) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Efavirenz had no effect on the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of saquinavir or ritonavir after 6 weeks of therapy. After 6 months of therapy, saquinavir and ritonavir Cmin were stable, however, there was a 27% decrease in saquinavir AUC and a 30% decrease in ritonavir AUC (compared to 6 week data). Therefore, efavirenz does not affect the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir or ritonavir when given in at a dose of 400/400 mg bd. The AUC and Cmax, but not the half life, of saquinavir and ritonavir decreased after long term administration suggesting changing bioavailability over time. <br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir 400/400 mg bid before, and after short- and long-term coadministration with efavirenz 600 mg qd. van Heeswijk R, Cooper C, Gallicano K, et al. 3rd International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Washington, 2002, abstract 7.4</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg bd) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. The addition of efavirenz led to ~10% reduction in saquinavir trough concentrations and a slight increase in ritonavir trough concentrations. Efavirenz concentrations were &gt;1000 ng/ml in 11/12 subjects. Overall, there was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir, ritonavir or efavirenz. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of the combination of ritonavir plus saquinavir with and without efavirenz in healthy volunteers.

<p><strong>Efavirenz/Amprenavir and 2nd PI</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

<p><strong>Nelfinavir/Ritonavir + Efavirenz (once daily)</strong></p>
<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on nelfinavir/ritonavir (1875/200 mg once daily) was studied in 24 healthy subjects. Following the addition of efavirenz, nelfinavir geometric mean AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 30%, 29% and 48% respectively. Nelfinavir Cmin increased in 21/24 subjects and decreased in 3/24 subjects. Ritonavir geometric mean AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 20%, 24% and 12% respectively. Efavirenz exposure was similar to historical data. <br /><em>Effect of efavirenz treatment on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir boosted by ritonavir in healthy volunteers. la Porte C, de Graaff-Teulen MJA, Colbers EPH, et al.

<p>There are no pharmacokinetic data available for the coadministration of efavirenz with the combination of saquinavir/ritonavir. Coadministration of saquinavir (soft gel 1200 mg every 8 hours) with efavirenz (600 mg) in 12 subjects led to decreases in saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 50%, 62%, and 56%, respectively.

<p>The combination of saquinavir and ritonavir with efavirenz has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of liver toxicity; liver function should be monitored when saquinavir and ritonavir are co-administered with efavirenz. No clinically significant alterations of either saquinavir or efavirenz concentration were noted in studies in healthy volunteers or in HIV-infected patients. No clinically relevant alterations of either saquinavir or efavirenz concentrations were noted when efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was coadministered with saquinavir/ritonavir (1600/200 mg once daily, or 1000/100 mg twice daily, or 1200/100 mg once daily).

<p>Appropriate doses for the combination of saquinavir/ritonavir with efavirenz with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Saquinavir concentrations are reduced when these drugs are coadministered. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg) and saquinavir (soft gel 1200 mg three time daily) to 13 healthy volunteers resulted in a 12% and 13% decrease in efavirenz AUC and Cmax respectively.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (200 mg) boosted saquinavir (1000 mg) with efavirenz (600 mg) were investigated in 11 Thai patients.

<p>The coadministration of efavirenz with 2 NRTIs (n=19) or with 2 NRTIs plus saquinavir/ritonavir (1000-800/100 mg twice daily, n=7) was studied in treatment experienced patients.

<p>Coadministration of soft gel saquinavir/ritonavir (1200/100 mg once daily) with efavirenz (600 mg) in 19 patients resulted in a saquinavir Cmax, Cmin and AUC of 2.49 &#181;g/ml, 0.24 &#181;g/ml and 18.98 &#181;g.h/ml, respectively. Efavirenz Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 5.73 &#181;g/ml, 2.44 g/ml and 86.39 &#181;g.h/ml, respectively. Saquinavir levels were lower than previously described with higher once daily doses. This could be due to the lower dose or the presence of efavirenz. Efavirenz concentrations were higher than those described without ritonavir but the half-life was similar. <br /><em>Once-daily saquinavir-sgc plus low-dose ritonavir (1200/100 mg) in combination with efavirenz: pharmacokinetics and efficacy in HIV-infected patients with prior antiretroviral therapy.

<p>The effect of adding efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg bd) was studied in 8 HIV+ subjects. Efavirenz had no effect on the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of saquinavir or ritonavir after 6 weeks of therapy. After 6 months of therapy, saquinavir and ritonavir Cmin were stable, however, there was a 27% decrease in saquinavir AUC and a 30% decrease in ritonavir AUC (compared to 6 week data). Therefore, efavirenz does not affect the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir or ritonavir when given in at a dose of 400/400 mg bd. The AUC and Cmax, but not the half life, of saquinavir and ritonavir decreased after long term administration suggesting changing bioavailability over time. <br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir 400/400 mg bid before, and after short- and long-term coadministration with efavirenz 600 mg qd. van Heeswijk R, Cooper C, Gallicano K, et al. 3rd International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Washington, 2002, abstract 7.4</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (400/400 mg bd) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers.

<p><strong>Efavirenz/Amprenavir and 2nd PI</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body.

<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

<p>The interaction between tacrolimus and antiretroviral therapy (ART) was studied in 4 HIV/HCV coinfected patients who had received liver transplants. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were determined at steady state during the post operative period before and after the reintroduction of ART once tacrolimus concentrations and liver function had stabilised. Patients taking efavirenz required a small change in tacrolimus dose, with tacrolimus oral clearance increasing from 277 to 530 ml/min.

<p>The management of drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and tacrolimus in 10 HIV patients was reported. Antiretroviral agents were stopped on the day of liver transplantation and reintroduced 10 days later. All patients received tacrolimus and prednisolone as immunosuppressive agents and fluconazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ganciclovir as primary prophylaxis. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters were measured 10 days following liver transplantation and 10 days following antiretroviral re-initiation. Tacrolimus target blood concentrations were 8-20 ng/ml from baseline to week 6 and 5-15 ng/ml after week 6; tacrolimus doses were individually adjusted according to the Ctrough measured. Among the patients studied, two were on nelfinavir, three on lopinavir/ritonavir, two on efavirenz and one on three NRTIs. While the NRTIs and efavirenz led to a slight change in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir caused a large inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism, resulting in an increase in its half-life and a decrease in its clearance. Therefore, tacrolimus plasma concentrations should be monitored and drug dose adjustments performed. No alteration in the antiretroviral pharmacokinetic parameters was observed. <br /><em>Teicher E, Taburet AM, Vincent I, et al. 12th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Boston, February 2005, abstract 662.</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but could potentially decrease the levels of tamoxifen and metabolites via induction of CYP3A4 and thereby reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. Coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of cytochromes, markedly reduced tamoxifen and its metabolites concentrations and a similar effect may be expected with efavirenz.</span>

<p>In a study, 20 subjects started telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) followed by efavirenz/tenofovir (600/300 mg once daily for 7 days) after a washout. Subsequently, they received telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 hours and efavirenz/tenofovir 600/300 mg once daily for 7 days or telaprevir 1500 mg every 12 hours and efavirenz/tenofovir 600/300 mg once daily for 7 days in a randomized order without a washout. When compared to data from telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone, the AUC and Cmin of telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 h decreased by 18% and 25%, but the AUC and Cmin of telaprevir 1500 every 12 h decreased by 20% and 48%. Efavirenz AUC and Cmin decreased by 18% and 10% with telaprevir 1125 mg every 8h, and decreased by 15% and 11% with telaprevir 1500 every 12 h. Tenofovir AUC and Cmin increased by 10% and 17% with telaprevir 1125 mg every 8h, and increased by 10% and 6% with telaprevir 1500 every 12 h.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between ARV agents and the investigational HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir in healthy volunteers.

<p>The interaction between tenofovir and efavirenz was assessed in TDM samples from groups of HIV+ patients receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily) alone or with tenofovir (300 mg once daily). Samples were collected 0.5-23.9 h post dose in the control group (n=118) and the tenofovir group (n=126).

<p>Nine cases have been reported of patients stable on efavirenz therapy who developed neuropsychiatric disturbances following the introduction of tenofovir to their antiretroviral regimens. The patients had been stable on efavirenz-containing regimens for a median duration of 31 months (range 5-58) during which no efavirenz related CNS effects were reported. Moderate to severe neuropsychiatric events occurred within 48 h of starting tenofovir in 5 patients, with symptoms developing in the remaining 4 patients after 2 weeks to 24 months after initiation of tenofovir. Treatment was changed in 6/9 patients; 3 switched from tenofovir to nevirapine, 2 to from tenofovir to zidovudine and one discontinued treatment. All 6 patients exhibited marked improvement in CNS intolerance. Of the 3 patients who remained on efavirenz and tenofovir, one had spontaneous progressive improvement within 2 weeks, but two had chronic persistent sleeping disorders. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were available for 2 patients before tenofovir (1.35 and 2.09 &#181;g/ml) and for 4 patients on tenofovir (1.30-1.95 &#181;g/ml). The neuropsychiatric disorders could be either a consequence of an unexplained interaction between efavirenz and tenofovir, or an infrequent tenofovir-related side effect. Further studies are required to evaluate precisely the incidence of these symptoms, including the assessment of efavirenz binding sites or metabolites. <br /><em>Neuropsychiatric adverse events after switching from an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz without tenofovir to an efavirenz regimen containing tenofovir: a report of nine cases.

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

No dosage adjustment is necessary. <br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily, 8 doses) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg bd) to 21 subjects resulted in decreases in tipranavir Cmax (21%), AUC (31%) and Cmin (42%) when compared to historical data (n=89). Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz were unaltered (increases of 9%, 4% and 2% for Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively). When tipranavir/ritonavir (750/200 mg bd) was coadministered with efavirenz (600 mg once daily, 8 doses) to 25 subjects, there was no change in the pharmacokinetics of tipranavir when compared to historical data (n=100); Cmax and Cmin decreased by 3% and AUC increased by 1%. There was no change in EFV AUC, a 12% increase in EFV Cmax and a 6% decrease in EFV Cmin.<br /><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012. <br />Standard doses of efavirenz, zidovudine, tenofovir and didanosine may be given with tipranavir/ritonavir.

<p>The effect of steady-state efavirenz on steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics was investigated in 16 healthy adult female and male volunteers. After dosing with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily with food) for 10 days, efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was added to the regimen for 14 days. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was done on days 10 and 24. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for AUC, Cmax, and Cmin comparing TPV/r alone and in combination with EFV were 0.97 (0.87 to 1.09), 0.92 (0.81 to 1.03), and 1.19 (0.93 to 1.54) for tipranavir, and 1.03 (0.78 to 1.38), 0.92 (0.65 to 1.30), and 1.04 (0.72 to 1.48) for ritonavir. With the exception of a 19% increase in tipranavir Cmin, which is considered not to be clinically relevant, efavirenz had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of tipranavir or ritonavir. Tipranavir/ritonavir can be safely coadministered with efavirenz and without the need for a dose adjustment. <br /><em>Lack of effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of tipranavir-ritonavir in healthy volunteers. la Porte CJ, Sabo JP, B&#233;&#239;que L, Cameron DW.

Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. In vitro data have shown that efavirenz does not inhibit P-gp but does inhibit BCRP and thus could potentially increase topotecan exposure and increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased efavirenz plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As efavirenz is an inducer of CYP450 enzymes, there may be potential to decrease levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

Coadministration of triclabendazole and drugs primarily metabolised by the cytochrome P450 enzymes may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drugs. Therefore, discontinuation of concomitant medications metabolised by the cytochrome P450 1A2, 2C9 or 3A4 enzymes, or monitoring of plasma concentrations of these co-medications may be necessary. <br /><em>Egaten&#174; (Triclabendazole) Summary of product Charateristics, Novartis Pharma AG Basel, Switzerland, Produced July 2000</em><br /><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the short term dosing of triclabendazole (usually single dose), the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to have marginal clinical effect.

Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Co-administration of efavirenz (400 mg orally once daily) with voriconazole (200 mg orally twice daily) decreased voriconazole AUC and Cmax by 77% and 61%, respectively, while efavirenz AUC and Cmax increased by 44% and 38%, respectively. Following co-administration of efavirenz (300 mg once daily) with voriconazole (400 mg twice daily) voriconazole AUC decreased by 7% and Cmax was increased by 23% compared to voriconazole 200 mg twice daily alone. Efavirenz AUC increased by 17% and Cmax was equivalent compared to efavirenz 600 mg once daily alone. When efavirenz is co-administered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose must be increased to 400 mg twice daily and the efavirenz dose should be reduced by 50%, i.e., to 300 mg once daily. When treatment with voriconazole is stopped, the initial dosage of efavirenz should be restored. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Efavirenz and voriconazole should not be coadministered at standard doses. Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations, and coadministration may decrease the therapeutic effectiveness of voriconazole. Also, voriconazole significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of efavirenz-associated side effects. When voriconazole is coadministered with efavirenz, voriconazole maintenance dose should be increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and efavirenz dose should be decreased to 300 mg once daily using the capsule formulation (one 200-mg and two 50-mg capsules or six 50-mg capsules). SUSTIVA tablets should not be broken. Coadministration of voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 days) and efavirenz (400 mg for 9 days) resulted in decreases in voriconazole Cmax and AUC of 61% and 77%. Efavirenz Cmax and AUC increased by 38% and 44% respectively. Reducing the voriconazole dose (to 300 mg twice daily) and efavirenz dose (to 300 mg daily) resulted in decreases in voriconazole Cmax and AUC of 36% and 55% when compared to values obtained with voriconazole alone (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 2 days). Efavirenz Cmax decreased by 14% and there was no change in AUC when compared to values obtained with efavirenz alone (600 mg once daily for 9 days). Coadministration of voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 5 days) and efavirenz (300 mg once daily for 7 days) resulted in a 23% increase in voriconazole Cmax and a 7% decrease in AUC when compared to values obtained with voriconazole alone (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 2 days). There was no change efavirenz Cmax and a 17% increase in AUC when compared to values obtained with efavirenz alone (600 mg once daily for 9 days).<br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>Different dose combinations of efavirenz (300 mg once daily) and voriconazole (300 or 400 mg twice daily) were assessed in HIV- subjects (n=16) and compared to standard-dose monotherapy with each drug (efavirenz 600 mg once daily or voriconazole 200 mg twice daily). Coadministration of the lower voriconazole dose decreased voriconazaole AUC (55%) and Cmax (36%) and had no effect on efavirenz AUC, but decreased efavirenz Cmax by 14%. In contrast, coadministration of the higher voriconazole dose decreased voriconazole AUC by 7%, but increased Cmax by 23%; efavirenz AUC increased by 17% and Cmax decreased by 4%. Based on the pharmacokinetic data obtained, the authors concluded that when co-administered, voriconazole dose should be increased to 400 mg twice daily and efavirenz dose decreased to 300 mg once daily in order to provide systemic exposures similar to standard-dose monotherapy. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions of efavirenz and voriconazole in healthy volunteers.

<p>A case report described the use of TDM to manage the voriconazole-efavirenz interaction in an HIV+ subject with cirrhosis, stable on an efavirenz-containing regimen (600 mg once daily) who required voriconazole for treatment of disseminated cryptococcosis following failure of fluconazole and amphotericin/flucytosine. Due to the presence of efavirenz, intravenous voriconazole was added to amphotericin/flucytosine at three times the recommended dose and resulted not only in remission of the cryptococcal clinical symptoms, but also decreased viral load to &lt;50 copies/ml. Trough concentrations were determined on days 11, 23 28 and 35; voriconazole troughs were 2.3, 2.2, 3.9 and 2.8 &#181;g/ml and efavirenz troughs were 4.7, 6.5, 4.7, and 6.5 &#181;g/m, respectively. Voriconazole AUC and Cmax were determined on day 28 and were 35.30 &#181;g.h/ml and 4.81 &#181;g/ml, respectively. Efavirenz AUC and Cmax on the same day were 134.7 &#181;g.h/ml and 8.6 &#181;g/ml, respectively. On day 35, trough concentrations in plasma and CSF were determined and CSF:plasma ratios for voriconazole were 0.35 and for efavirenz were 0.13. The patient was switched to maintenance therapy with oral voriconazole (300 mg twice daily) with efavirenz (600 mg once daily). TDM was performed every three weeks which guided dose modifications, first to decrease efavirenz to 400 mg once daily, and then to decrease both voriconazole (to 200 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (to 300mg once daily). After 15 months of follow up on this regimen, the patient remained symptom free and with an undetectable viral load. <br /><em>Efficacy and safety of TDM assisted combination therapy with voriconazole plus efavirenz in aids patients with cryptococcosis.

                    <span><p>Specific interaction studies have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than lamivudine, zidovudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Clinically significant interactions are not expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways. No dosage adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of zidovudine (300 mg every 12 hours for 14 days) with efavirenz (600 mg for 14 days) in 9 subjects caused no alteration in zidovudine Cmax and AUC and a 225% increase in Cmin. No dose adjustment is recommended when efavirenz is given with zidovudine. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p></span>
