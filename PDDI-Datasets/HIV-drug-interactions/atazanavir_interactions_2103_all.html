                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. A clinical study with ritonavir suggests there is potential for levels of albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide to be reduced when co-administered with ritonavir, potentially lowering clinical effect of albendazole. The clinical significance of an interaction with ritonavir boosted or unboosted atazanavir is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Ritonavir, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have the potential to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of albendazole; albendazole sulfoxide. The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but may result in decreased efficacy, especially in the treatment of systemic helminth infections. Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em></span>

<div>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

                    <span><div>A case reports describes a 51-year-old woman with HIV who presented with weight gain and a 1-month history of right hip pain.&nbsp; Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, &gt;570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patient&#8217;s weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushing&#8217;s syndrome.<br /><em>Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

<div>A case report describes a 75 year old man with a history of HIV for 27 years, hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, recurrent deep venous thrombosis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease was admitted for treatment of worsening chronic diarrhoea and bright red blood per rectum. His antiretroviral regimen was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg daily), lamivudine (150 mg daily) and nevirapine (300 mg twice daily). Other medications included atenolol, atropine/diphenoxylate, calcitriol, cholecalciferol, fondaparinux, levothyroxine, lisinopril, loperamide, ranitidine, testosterone patch, trazodone, and vardenafil.&nbsp; Colonoscopy showed lymphocytic colitis at multiple biopsy sites and oral budesonide (3 mg 3 times a day) was started. The patient's diarrhoea improved, but he was admitted 12 days later with 10.4 kg weight gain, severe leg and facial swelling, and uncontrolled hypertension.&nbsp; Physical examination was notable for blood pressure 177/102 mm Hg, cushingoid facies, and 2+ pedal and pretibial edema to the knees.&nbsp; As the colitis had improved dramatically with budesonide therapy, the plan was to continue it for a full 6-week treatment course, if possible. Amlodipine, hydralazine, and furosemide were added to control the hypertension and edema, but budesonide was discontinued after 3 weeks because of persistent severe edema that was refractory to furosemide. The patient developed edema, weight gain, uncontrolled hypertension,&nbsp; cushingoid facies, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis shortly&nbsp;after initiation of budenoside, with resolution of all symptoms&nbsp; soon after it was stopped.&nbsp; Congestive heart failure, liver disease, and nephrotic syndrome were ruled out as causes of the edema, which supported the diagnosis of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. Although budesonide concentrations were not measured, the very low serum cortisol level (0.8 µg/dL) in a clinical setting of hypercortisolism provides strong indirect evidence that levels of an exogenous corticosteroid (ie, budesonide) were high.<br><em>Cushing’s syndrome due to antiretroviral-budesonide interaction.

                    <span><p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominately by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to PPX, both mediated by cytochrome P4503A4. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<div>The interaction between buprenorphine and atazanavir (400 mg once daily) or atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was investigated in opioid-dependent, buprenorphine/naloxone-maintained, HIV-negative volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir were compared in subjects and matched, healthy controls (n=10 per group) to determine effects of buprenorphine. When coadministered with atazanavir, buprenorphine AUC increased from 39.5 to 76.3 ng.h/ml; a similar increase was observed when coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir (46.2 to 77.0 ng.h/ml). Concentrations of norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine glucuronide, and norbuprenorphine glucuronide also increased with both atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Buprenorphine did not significantly alter atazanavir or ritonavir concentrations. Three buprenorphine/naloxone-maintained participants reported increased sedation with atazanavir/ritonavir. A decreased buprenorphine dose may be required. <br /><em>Interaction between buprenorphine and atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir. McCance-Katz EF, Moody DE, Morse GD,et al.

<p>Three case reports have recently been published on a pharmacokinetic interaction between buprenorphine and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir.<br />The first subject had been titrated to a stable dose of buprenorphine 14 mg/day prior to the commencement of ddI (250 mg), tenofovir (300 mg) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg), all given once daily. The next day the subject began to experience daytime somnolence and decreased mental functioning. After two weeks, during which the subject was offered additional counselling, buprenorphine was decreased to 8 mg/day and this resulted in tolerance to the sedative effects after 7 days. The subject was finally stabilised on buprenorphine 10 mg/day. <br />The second subject was stable on once daily ddI (250 mg), tenofovir (300 mg), atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg) and twice daily olanzepine (5 mg) prior to induction with buprenorphine (8 mg/day). On the second day of induction, the subject reported feeling &#8220;doped up&#8220;, and required a dose reduction of buprenorphine to 8 mg every other day to improve the feelings of opiate excess. <br />The third subject had been receiving lamivudine (300 mg), tenofovir (300 mg) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg) once daily prior to the initiation of buprenorphine (8 mg/day). Following the commencement of buprenorphine, the subject reported feeling dizzy, &#8220;high&#8220; and &#8220;over medicated&#8220;. Buprenorphine was reduced to 8 mg every other day; however, though this improved the dizziness the corresponding opiate cravings required dose modification to 8 mg daily and a further dose increase to 12 mg daily. At this dose, the subject experienced hypersomnolence but elected to remain on the higher dose as it suppressed the opiate craving. Tolerance developed over a week and the hypersomnolence gradually ceased.<br />Phase I metabolism of buprenorphine is primarily by CYP3A4 to norbuprenorphine, with phase II metabolism being mainly through glucuronidation. The authors postulate that atazanavir and/or ritonavir inhibited CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, with atazanavir having an additional inhibitory effect on glucuronidation, resulting in increased concentrations of buprenorphine and clinical symptoms of opiate excess. They recommend caution if using buprenorphine with atazanavir or ritonavir and suggest beginning with reduced doses of buprenorphine and slower dose escalation to allow for assessment of opiate excess. <br /><em>Three case reports of a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction with buprenorphine and atazanavir plus ritonavir. <br /><em>Bruce RD, Altice FL.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Pharmacokinetic studies between atazanavir and drugs that prolong the PR interval including beta blockers (other than atenolol) have not been performed. An additive effect of atazanavir and these drugs cannot be excluded. Caution should be exercised when atazanavir is given concurrently with these drugs. </span>

                    <span><div>The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

                      <span>H2-receptor antagonists reduce the absorption of atazanavir, but the extent of the interaction can depend on dose and timing of administration. Famotidine decreased atazanavir AUC by ~20%. In the ABSENCE OF TENOFOVIR, the SPC recommends no dose modification of atazanavir/ritonavir if the cimetidine dose does not exceed that comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily; at higher doses of cimetidine, atazanavir/ritonavir should be increased to 400/100 mg once daily. In the PRESENCE OF TENOFOVIR, the SPC recommends atazanavir/ritonavir should be increased to 400/100 mg once daily. The US Prescribing Information states that in TREATMENT NAIVE patients, cimetidine should not exceed that comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily and atazanavir/ritonavir should be dosed at 300/100 mg once daily either with or at least 10 h after the H2RA. For patients unable to tolerate ritonavir (who are not pregnant), atazanavir 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. In TREATMENT EXPERIENCED patients, cimetidine should not exceed that comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily and atazanavir/ritonavir should be dosed at 300/100 mg once daily either with or at least 10 h after the H2RA. In TREATMENT EXPERIENCED patients WITH TENOFOVIR atazanavir/ritonavir should be increased to 400/100 mg once daily either with or at least 10 h after the H2RA. In TREATMENT EXPERIENCED pregnant patients atazanavir/ritonavir should be increased to 400/100 mg once daily either with or at least 10 h after the H2RA during the second and third trimester.

                    <span><div>For patients NOT TAKING TENOFOVIR, if atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg and H2receptor antagonists are coadministered, a dose equivalent to famotidine 20 mg twice daily should not be exceeded. If a higher dose of an H2-receptor antagonist is required (eg, famotidine 40 mg twice daily or equivalent) an increase of the atazanavir/ritonavir dose from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg can be considered.&nbsp; For patients WHO ARE TAKING TENOFOVIR, if atazanavir/ritonavir with both tenofovir and an H2-receptor antagonist are co-administered, a dose increase of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir is recommended. A dose equivalent to famotidine 40 mg twice daily should not be exceeded. During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, if an H2-receptor antagonist is needed, a dose increase to atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with TDM may be considered. It is not recommended to use atazanavir with ritonavir for pregnant patients who are receiving both tenofovir and an H2-receptor antagonist.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em><br /><br />Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if H2-receptor antagonists are administered with atazanavir. Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients, atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, a dose of the H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA). An H2RA dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg once daily up to a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily can be used with atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment-naive patients. For treatment-naive patients unable to tolerate ritonavir, atazanavir 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. No single dose of the H2RA should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg, and the total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg. The use of atazanavir without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended. In treatment-experienced adult patients, whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the atazanavir and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA. Atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA. Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir and an H2RA. Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester. Atazanavir is not recommended for pregnant women during the second and third trimester taking atazanavir with both tenofovir and an H2RA.<br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em><br /><br /></div>The Bristol Myers Squibb perspective on the administration of H2-receptor antagonists (H2-RA) and atazanavir was published in an article in JAIDS in mid 2006. In summary they state:<br /><p>&#8226; H2-RAs increase intragastric pH and reduce atazanavir absorption. However,<br />&#8226; H2-RAs are less potent than proton pump inhibitors in suppressing intragastric pH and may be used with atazanavir. <br />&#8226; Atazanavir/ritonavir at 300/100 mg may be used concomitantly with H2-RAs although temporal separation (giving ATV/r 10 hours after or 2 hours before the H2-RA) should be considered in treatment experienced patients. <br />&#8226; Local prescribing information may vary.<br />Based on current data the above approach to managing the interaction is appropriate although some may feel that temporal separation of the H2-RA and atazanavir/ritonavir would be safer in all patients. Note: The authors clearly state that due to the magnitude of the decrease in exposure, atazanavir should NOT be used concomitantly with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). <br /><em>Further information on the administration of H2-receptor antagonists with atazanavir. Agarwala S, Thal G, Nettles R, Bertz R. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 42: 516.</em></p>
<p>Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 1.85 &#181;g/ml) compared to 1.12 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 3.17 &#181;g/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 &#181;g/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted. <br /><em>Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) and atazanavir (400 mg once daily) increased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 28%, 6% and 91%, respectively. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of clarithromycin increased by 94%, 50% and 160%, respectively, but AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 14-OH clarithromycin decreased by 70%, 72% and 62%, respectively. A dose reduction of clarithromycin may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin. The mechanism of the clarithromycin/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition. No recommendation regarding dose reduction can be made; therefore, caution should be exercised if atazanavir/ritonavir is co-administered with clarithromycin. Particular caution should be used when prescribing atazanavir in association with medicinal products which have the potential to increase the QT interval and/or in patients with pre-existing risk factors (bradycardia, long congenital QT, electrolyte imbalances).<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg once daily) resulted in no change in atazanavir Cmax, a 1.28-fold increase in AUC and a 1.91 fold increase in Cmin (n=29). Cmax, AUC and Cmin of clarithromycin were increased by 1.5-, 1.94-fold, and 2.64-fold (n=21); Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the active metabolite (14-OH clarithromycin) decreased by 72%, 70% and 62% respectively. Increased concentrations of clarithromycin may cause QTc prolongations; therefore, a dose reduction of clarithromycin by 50% should be considered when it is coadministered with atazanavir. In addition, concentrations of the active metabolite 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced; consider alternative therapy for indications other than infections due to <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir with clarithromycin has not been studied. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co,</em><em><em> September 2015</em>.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was studied in 30 healthy subjects. The steady state Cmax and AUC of atazanavir were higher in the presence of clarithromycin (Cmax, 5136 and 5421 ng/ml, 6% increase; AUC 29493 and 37790 ng/ml.h, 28% increase). The steady state Cmax and AUC of clarithromycin were 50% and 94% higher in the presence of atazanavir; this was accompanied by a 70% decrease in exposure of 14-OH clarithromycin. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetic interaction study of atazanavir with clarithromycin in healthy subjects.

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

<p>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. An alternative to clopidogrel should be considered.</span>

In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. As an inhibitor of CYP3A, atazanavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known.

                      <span>A clinical study reported that ritonavir had no effect on daunorubicin (liposomal) pharmacokinetics. An in vitro study has shown that daunorubicin was able to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, but was unlikely to cause clinically significant drug interactions via this mechanism. There is therefore little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of daunorubicin treatment and may include dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities.

                    <span><div>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></div>

<div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<p>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of treatment with daunorubicin hydrochloride and may include: dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities (ST-T wave changes, low voltage QRS complex, T waves). Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, endomyocardial fibrosis, pericarditis/myocarditis have also been reported. Careful monitoring of cardiac function before, during and after treatment is therefore recommended in order to identify the risk of cardiac complications as early as possible. Risk factors for cardiac toxicity include active or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/ pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility; or cardiotoxic drugs.<br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012.</em></div></span>

                    <span>A case reports describes a 51-year-old woman with HIV who presented with weight gain and a 1-month history of right hip pain.&nbsp; Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, &gt;570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patient&#8217;s weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushing&#8217;s syndrome.<br /><em>Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

</p><div>Coadministration of atazanavir with didanosine buffered tablets resulted in a marked decrease in atazanavir exposure. It is recommended that atazanavir be given (with food) 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine buffered formulations. Simultaneous administration of didanosine EC and atazanavir with food results in a decrease in didanosine exposure but has no significant effect on atazanavir exposures. Thus, atazanavir and didanosine EC should be administered at different times. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg single dose) with didanosine buffered tablets (200 mg single dose) did not alter exposure to didanosine (8% and 2% reduction in Cmax and AUC respectively, n=31); however, exposure to atazanavir was markedly decreased (Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 89%, 87% and 84% respectively, n =31. Administration of atazanavir (400 mg single dose) 1 h after ddI buffered tablets (200 mg single dose), resulted in no significant change in atazanavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin (12%, 3%, and 3% increase respectively, n=31). <br />

Reduced plasma didanosine exposure was observed when didanosine was administered with atazanavir (or atazanavir/ritonavir) and food consistent with the effect of food previously observed on didanosine. Both drugs should therefore be administered as per their current dosing recommendations but at different times: didanosine in the fasted state and atazanavir with food. <br />

The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially increase dihydrocodeine exposure (inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) and increase the conversion to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide (induction of UGT2B7).

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter atazanavir/ritonavir exposure, but caution is advised with atazanavir alone.</span>

The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted. Certainly echinacea could contribute to inter-patient variability in protease inhibitor levels. <br /><em>The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) root on cytochrome P450 activity in vivo.

A study in 13 patients showed that boosting atazanavir with ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with co-administered efavirenz (600 mg once daily) increased Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 14%, 39% and 48%, respectively, compared to unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) without efavirenz.

<p>Atazanavir trough concentrations (24 &#177; 4 h post dose) were determined in HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily n=12 or 400/100 once daily n=20) with an NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) or atazanavir/ritonavir alone (300/100 mg once daily n=154). Coadministration of an NNRTI resulted in a 5.5-fold decrease in atazanavir trough concentrations; increasing the dose to 400/100 mg decreased the magnitude of the reduction to 1.7-fold, but did not overcome the inducer effect of the NNRTI on atazanavir metabolism. In the presence of an NNRTI, median (range) atazanavir troughs were 92 (24-415) ng/ml and 290 (71-2069) ng/ml for the 300/100 and 400/100 mg doses, respectively.

It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as ritonavir&nbsp;may reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required.

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

If the combination of atazanavir with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded. Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) 2 hours before atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 61%, 66% and 65%, respectively. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg once daily) 1 hour before an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 30%, 31% and 31%, relative to atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) without omeprazole. The decrease in AUC, Cmax and Cmin was not mitigated when an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. Although not studied, similar results are expected with other proton pump inhibitors. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with proton pump inhibitors.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em><br /><br />Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg or atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients, the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose. In treatment-experienced adult patients, the use of PPIs in treatment-experienced patients receiving atazanavir is not recommended.<br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em><br /></div></span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><div>Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing 25 microgram ethinylestradiol and norgestimate with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) decreased ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 19%, 16% and 37%, respectively.&nbsp; The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of norgestimate increased by 1.85-fold, 1.68-fold and 2.02-fold, respectively. While the concentration of ethinylestradiol was increased with atazanavir given alone, due to both UGT and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, the net effect of atazanavir/ritonavir is a decrease in ethinylestradiol levels because of the inducing effect of ritonavir. The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side-effects (e.g. insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance. If an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30 microgram of ethinylestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen. Co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided. An alternate reliable method of contraception is recommended.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em></div>
<p>Use with caution if coadministration of atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir with oral contraceptives is considered. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with ethinylestradiol and norethindrone, in 19 subjects, caused a 15%, 48% and 91% increase in ethinylestradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively; norethindrone Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 1.67-, 2.1- and a 3.62-fold, respectively. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with ethinylestradiol and norgestimate was studied in 14 subjects. Ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 19%, 16% and 37%, respectively; AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 17-desacteyl norgestimate increased by 85%, 68% and 102%, respectively. If an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. If atazanavir is administered without ritonavir, the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Potential safety risks include substantial increases in progesterone exposure. The long-term effects of increases in concentration of the progestational agent are unknown and could increase the risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and acne. Coadministration of atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives (eg, contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestagens other than norethindrone or norgestimate, or less than 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, has not been studied; therefore, alternative methods of contraception are recommended.<br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<div>An open-label, three-period, single-sequence study assessed the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive when give alone (35 &#181;g ethinyl estradiol plus norgestimate) or with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily with 25 &#181;g ethinyl estradiol plus norgestimate).&nbsp; Dose normalised results showed ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 19%, 16% and 37%, respectively,&nbsp;whereas the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 17-deacetyl norgestimate (active metabolite) increased by 85%, 68%&nbsp;and 102%, respectively.&nbsp; The authors concluded that increasing the ethinyl estradiol component to 30-35 &#181;g when co-administered with atazanavir/ritonavir might be desirable to minimise breakthrough bleeding.<br /><em>The effect of atazanavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate in healthy women.

<div><br /></div><div>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (35 &#181;g) and norethindrone (1000 &#181;g) was studied in 22 women. Co-administration of daily doses of the oral contraceptive and 400 mg atazanavir produced 67% and 110% increases in Cmax and AUC of norethindrone, respectively, and 15% and 48% increases in the Cmax and AUC of ethinylestradiol, respectively, compared to the administration alone.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br />Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes. <em>Henderson MC, Siddens LK, Morr&#233; JT, et al.

Etonogestrel is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir and etonogestrel implants increased etonogestrel exposure (52%, 61%, and 34% increases in AUC, Cmax, and Cmin, respectively) suggesting that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of etonogestrel implants. Similarly, coadministration with atazanavir could potentially increase etonogestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only etonogestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced.

A higher dose of famotidine (40 mg twice daily) decreased atazanavir AUC by 24%, decreased Cmax by 23% and decreased Cmin by 25%. Decreases with both doses of famotidine were relative to atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir 300/100/300 mg single doses with food. When compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg without tenofovir, atazanavir concentrations are expected to be additionally decreased by about 20%. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></div>
<p><div>Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if H2-receptor antagonists are administered with atazanavir. Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients, atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, a dose of the H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA). An H2RA dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg once daily up to a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily can be used with atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment-naive patients. For treatment-naive patients unable to tolerate ritonavir, atazanavir 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA. No single dose of the H2RA should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg, and the total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg. The use of atazanavir without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended. In treatment-experienced adult patients, whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the atazanavir and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA. Atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA. Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir and an H2RA. Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester. Atazanavir is not recommended for pregnant women during the second and third trimester taking atazanavir with both tenofovir and an H2RA. The effect of famotidine (40 mg twice daily) on atazanavir exposure was investigated in various scenarios. When given simultaneously with atazanavir (400 mg once daily), atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 47%, 41% and 42% respectively. When atazanavir (400 mg once daily) was given 10 h after and 2 h before famotidine, atazanavir Cmax increased by 8% and AUC and Cmin decreased by 5% and 21% respectively. When famotidine was given simultaneously with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 14%, 18% and 28% respectively (this Cmax value was similar, and AUC and Cmin were 1.79-fold and 4.46-fold higher relative to atazanavir 400 mg once daily alone). Administration of atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir (300/100/300 mg once daily, after a light meal) 10 hours after the evening and 2 h before the morning doses of famotidine decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 26%, 21% and 28%, respectively. Coadministration of famotidine (20 mg twice daily) simultaneously with atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir (300/100/300 mg once daily, after a light meal) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 9%, 10% and 19%, respectively. Similar results were noted when the same doses were administered 10 h after and 2 h before famotidine. Administration of famotidine (40 mg once daily) 12 hours before atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir (300/100/300 mg once daily, after a light meal) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 11%, 12% and 23%, respectively. Increasing the atazanavir dose to 400 mg (with ritonavir 100 mg once daily) when given with famotidine (40 mg twice daily) resulted in similar atazanavir exposure to that obtained with 300/100 mg alone (Cmax increased by 2%, AUC increased by 3%, Cmin decreased by 14%). <br /></div><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<p>The effect of famotidine (20 or 40 mg twice daily) on the steady state pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily, alone or with tenofovir 300 mg once daily) was studied in HIV+ subjects. The lower famotidine dose when administered simultaneously in the absence of tenofovir had no effect on atazanavir Cmin, but decreased atazanavir AUC by 13%. The same dose administered temporally separated in the presence of tenofovir decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 21%, 21% and 19%, respectively. The higher dose of famotidine, administered either simultaneously or temporally separated reduced atazanavir exposure by 20-23% in subjects not receiving tenofovir and by 23-25% in subjects receiving tenofovir. <br /><em>Effects of famotidine on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir when given with ritonavir with or without tenofovir in HIV-infected subjects.

<p>The effect of famotidine (20 mg twice daily dosed with or 2 h apart, 40 mg once daily dosed 12 h apart, or 40 mg twice daily) on atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was studied in 20 HIV- subjects. Atazanavir exposures were similar when given alone or with famotidine 20 mg twice daily (both together and apart) or with 40 mg once daily. Decreases in atazanavir exposure (AUC 21%, Cmax 26%, Cmin 28%) were seen when famotidine 40 mg was given twice daily. <br /><em>Effect of famotidine 20 and 40 mg dosing regimens on the bioavailability of atazanavir with ritonavir in combination with tenofovir in healthy subjects.

<p>The Bristol Myers Squibb perspective on the administration of H2-receptor antagonists (H2-RA) and atazanavir was published in an article in JAIDS in mid 2006. In summary they state:<br />&#8226; H2-RAs increase intragastric pH and reduce atazanavir absorption. However,<br />&#8226; H2-RAs are less potent than proton pump inhibitors in suppressing intragastric pH and may be used with atazanavir. <br />&#8226; Atazanavir/ritonavir at 300/100 mg may be used concomitantly with H2-RAs although temporal separation (giving ATV/r 10 hours after or 2 hours before the H2-RA) should be considered in treatment experienced patients. <br />&#8226; Local prescribing information may vary.<br />Based on current data the above approach to managing the interaction is appropriate although some may feel that temporal separation of the H2-RA and atazanavir/ritonavir would be safer in all patients. Note: The authors clearly state that due to the magnitude of the decrease in exposure, atazanavir should NOT be used concomitantly with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). <br /><em>Further information on the administration of H2-receptor antagonists with atazanavir.

<p>Two studies were designed to evaluate the effect of the H2 antagonist famotidine (40 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of ATV in groups of healthy subjects (n=16). In one study, subjects received ATV 400 mg alone for 6 days, followed by either ATV + famotidine together, ATV + famotidine + cola together, ATV + famotidine separated (10 h post morning ATV dose and 2 h prior to evening ATV dose), or ATV 300 mg twice daily + famotidine + RTV (100 mg twice daily). In the second study, following 10 days of ATV/RTV (300/100 mg twice daily), subjects received ATV/RTV + famotidine, ATV/RTV + famotidine + cola, or ATV/RTV (400/100 mg) + famotidine. When compared to ATV 400 mg alone, the addition of famotidine reduced ATV AUC and Cmin by 41% and 42% respectively. Separating the administration of ATV and famotidine reduced the effect on AUC and Cmin (GMR 0.95 and 0.79 respectively). The addition of RTV to ATV 300 mg with famotidine resulted in increased AUC (79%) and Cmin (546%). Relative to a boosted 300/100 mg regimen, famotidine reduced ATV AUC and Cmin by 18% and 28% respectively. Increasing ATV to 400 mg when given with famotidine and RTV produced similar AUC and Cmin (GMR 1.03 and 0.86 respectively). The administration of cola did not mitigate the effects of famotidine in either study. The authors concluded that patients receiving ATV 400 mg unboosted and who require famotidine can either switch to ATV/RTV 300/100 mg twice daily, or remain on an unboosted regimen, but take famotidine 10 h after and 2 h prior to ATV. Patients on boosted ATV regimens (ATV/RTV 300/100 mg twice daily) should increase ATV to 400/100 mg when given with famotidine. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic effect of famotidine on atazanavir with and without ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 11.</em></p>
<p>Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 1.85 &#181;g/ml) compared to 1.12 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 3.17 &#181;g/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 &#181;g/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted. <br /><em>Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Fluphenazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. Atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levels of fluphenazine via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing likelihood of adverse events. Asymptomatic PR prolongations have been observed with atazanavir in clinical studies. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.  The impact on the PR interval of coadministration with ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval has not been evaluated. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir  and fluphenazine should be undertaken with caution.

<div>Fluphenazine is metabolised by P450 2D6 and is itself an inhibitor of this drug metabolising enzyme. The plasma concentrations and the effects of fluphenazine may therefore be increased and prolonged by drugs that are either the substrates or inhibitors of this P450 isoform, possibly resulting in severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects. The effects of phenothiazines on the heart are dose-related. ECG changes with prolongation of the QT interval and T-Wave changes have been reported commonly in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have also occurred after overdosage. Sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths have been reported in hospitalised psychotic patients receiving phenothiazines. The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, concurrent use of these drugs and fluphenazine is contraindicated.<br /><em>Modecate Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-aventis, December 2011.</em></div></span>

The fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%) Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolized via the P450 3A pathway, e.g., budesonide. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are yet unknown. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition. Co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone).

<p>Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and atazanavir (without ritonavir) may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate. Use with caution. Consider alternatives to fluticasone propionate, particularly for long-term use. Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and atazanavir/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression, have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. <br><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Formoterol is eliminated primarily by direct glucuronidation, with O-demethylation (by CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 2A6) followed by further glucuronidation being another pathway. As multiple CYP450 and UGT enzymes catalyze the transformation the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction is low. However formoterol may prolong the QT interval and the European SPC for atazanavir advises caution when coprescribing with drugs known to induce QT interval prolongation.</span>

                    <span><p>According to current treatment guidelines, dual therapy with protease inhibitors is generally not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir (300 mg once daily) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) decreased atazanavir Cmax and AUC by 24% and 22%, and had no effect on Cmin (compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily). There was no effect on amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. No dosage adjustment is necessary.<br /><em>Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, May 2011.</em></p>
<p>The interaction of atazanavir with fosamprenavir alone has not been evaluated. Coadministration of atazanavir (300 mg once daily for 10 days) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 10 days) was studied in 22 subjects. There was no change in Cmax, AUC or Cmin of amprenavir. Atazanavir Cmax decreased by 24%, AUC decreased by 22% and there was no change in Cmin.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily) and atazanavir (400 mg once daily) when administered alone and in combination (without ritonavir) were investigated in 21 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration resulted in decreases in atazanavir AUC (33%), Cmax (30%) and Cmin (57%), and increases in amprenavir AUC (78%), Cmax (36%) and Cmin (283%). The clinical relevance of these findings will remain unknown until controlled efficacy studies are completed.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of once-daily fosamprenavir 1400 mg plus atazanavir 400 mg without ritonavir in HIV-negative subjects.

<p>The effect of adding atazanavir (300 mg once daily) to fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) or adding fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) plus a second 100 mg ritonavir dose to atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was investigated in 22 healthy subjects. Atazanavir had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir (Ctrough 2470 vs 2290 ng/ml, Cmax 4990 vs 5210 ng/ml, AUC 35600 vs 35200 ng/ml.h; geometric means, alone vs +atazanavir). Ritonavir Ctrough, Cmax and AUC were increased by 37%, 96% and 93%, respectively by the addition of atazanavir. Addition of fosamprenavir and a second dose of ritonavir resulted in no change in atazanavir Ctrough, a 24% decrease in Cmax and a 22% decrease in AUC (Ctrough 741 vs 723 ng/ml, Cmax 4000 vs 3000 ng/ml, AUC, 40900 vs 31500 ng/ml.h; geometric means, alone vs +fosamprenavir/ritonavir). Given no change in amprenavir exposure and a modest decrease in atazanavir exposure, this combination could be evaluated in clinical trials in HIV+ subjects.<br /><em>The pharmacokinetic interaction between fosamprenavir/ritonavir and atazanavir in healthy adult subjects (APC10018). Wire MB, et al. 10th European AIDS Conference, Dublin, November 2005, abstract 4.3/9.</em></p>
<p>Trough concentrations of atazanavir and amprenavir were determined over a 12 weeks in HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir/ritonavir (150/700/100 mg twice daily, n=9 or 200/700/100 mg twice daily, n=5). Atazanavir concentrations at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were 0.96, 1.66, 1.55 and 1.0 &#181;g/ml for 150 mg twice daily and 1.15, 0.77, 1.36 and 1.07 &#181;g/ml for 200 mg twice daily. Amprenavir concentrations at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were 1.19, 2.19, 2.71, 1.85 &#181;g/ml when given with atazanavir 150 mg twice daily and 2.71, 1.88, 2.58 and 2.43 &#181;g/ml when given with atazanavir 200 mg twice daily. Overall clinical tolerance was excellent and the results appear to indicate that either combination could offer adequate trough concentrations for both drugs.<br /><em>Interaction between atazanavir and fosAmprenavir in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Khanlou et al. 3rd IAS Conference, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 2005, abstract WePe3.3C11.</em></p>
<p>ATV and APV trough concentrations were monitored in 7 patients receiving ATV (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily). All patients achieved full virological suppression over 3-12 months. The median ATV trough concentration was 361 ng/ml (range 271-1336 ng/ml); ATV Cmax (mean &#177; sd) was 2634 &#177; 2829 ng/ml). The median APV trough concentration was 2570 ng/ml (range 371-6767 ng/ml); APV Cmax (mean &#177; sd) was 7381 &#177; 2723 ng/ml). Interpatient variability was higher for ATV than APV, though trough concentrations for both drugs were above recommended IC90s.<br /><em>Double PI boosting with atazanavir and fos-amprenavir: favourable pharmacokinetics. Zilly, M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 93.</em></p>
<p>Trough concentrations of atazanavir and amprenavir were obtained 2 weeks after starting therapy in 2 patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir (200/700 mg twice daily) and 5 patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir/ritonavir (150/700/100 mg twice daily). Atazanavir concentrations in the 2 patients on the unboosted regimen were 0.64 and 0.68 &#181;g/ml and were below the range observed for the boosted regimen (0.77-1.63 &#181;g/ml). Amprenavir concentrations in the 2 patients on the unboosted regimen were 2.23 and 2.46 &#181;g/ml and were within the range observed for the boosted regimen (0.40-2.67 &#181;g/ml). These preliminary results appear to indicate adequate trough concentrations may be obtained with the triple PI regimen and further studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics and virological efficacy for this combination and doses are warranted. <br /><em>Favorable interaction between atazanavir and fosamprenavir with and without ritonavir in the treatment of HIV-infected patients.

<p>The coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) was investigated in 4 HIV+ patients. Median Cmax, AUC and Cmin values for amprenavir were 4830 ng/ml, 51300 ng/ml.h and 1490 ng/ml respectively. Results suggest that amprenavir concentrations are substantially increased by atazanavir and were comparable with (or even higher than) those achieved with boosted amprenavir (600 mg with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of amprenavir given once or twice daily when combined with atazanavir in heavily pretreated HIV-positive patients.

The patient reported consuming garlic cloves (six garlic cloves three times weekly) and trough atazanavir concentrations were found to be sub-optimal (178 and 121 ng/ml).

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Atazanavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier). Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of atazanavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as atazanavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), latest modification: 20-Aug-2010<br />Wagner T. Clin Pharmacokinet 1994; 26: 439&#8211;56; Boddy AV, Yule SM.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. The effect of atazanavir/ritonavir on imatinib exposure is difficult to predict as clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors have yielded differing results. Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as atazanavir.</span>

There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.<br /><em>Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.</em></p>
<p>There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.<br /><em>Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.</em></p>
<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) 2 hours before atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 61%, 66% and 65%, respectively.

The decrease in AUC, Cmax and Cmin was not mitigated when an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. Although not studied, similar results are expected with other proton pump inhibitors. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with proton pump inhibitors.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em><br /><br />Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg or atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients, the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose.

<p>A case report described the absence of an interaction with atazanavir/ritonavir and lansoprazole. A 40-year old HIV+ man received atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), tenofovir and lamivudine with lansoprazole (30 mg twice daily). Atazanavir concentrations determined pre- and 2 h post dose were 400 ng/ml and 720 ng/ml, respectively. Further samples were collected at 1, 3, 5 and 7 h post dose; using these concentrations, a 24h AUC was calculated as 46910 ng.h/ml. Despite coadministration of both lansoprazole and tenofovir, the patient&#8217;s plasma concentrations remained consistent with historical values, with a trough concentration well above the established values for atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir. His viral load remained undetectable and he continued immunological stability. <br /><em>Lack of interaction between atazanavir and lansoprazole. Kosel BW, Storey SS, Collier AC. AIDS, 2005, 19(6): 637-638.</em></p>
<p>Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 1.85 &#181;g/ml) compared to 1.12 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 3.17 &#181;g/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 &#181;g/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted. <br /><em>Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

An analysis of 570 HIV-infected women in Swaziland using levonorgestrel implant and lopinavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or efavirenz based regimens suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of levonorgestrel implant. Similarly, atazanvir/ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception. Coadministration of atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir with non-oral hormonal contraceptives (eg, contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestagens other than norethindrone or norgestimate has not been studied; therefore, alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</span>

<p>Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atroventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. Kaletra should be used with caution in such patients..<br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The impact on the PR interval of coadministration of Kaletra with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, coadministration of Kaletra with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>This phase I, open-label, 3-period, fixed sequence pharmacokinetic study was in healthy volunteers (n=15). Period I was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily); period II was atazanavir (300 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily); period III was atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the last day of each dosing period. The main findings were:<br />Atazanavir Cmin was 45% higher in period II vs period I, AUC did not differ and there was a trend to lower Cmax. <br />The additional ritonavir in period III did not significantly increase atazanavir Cmin, AUC or Cmax compared to period II. <br />The additional ritonavir in period III increased lopinavir Cmin by 28% compared with period II. <br />The authors conclude that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) plus atazanavir (300 mg once daily) gives appropriate pharmacokinetic profiles and could be further evaluated in treatment experienced patients. <br /><em>Beneficial pharmacokinetic interaction between atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. Pham PA, Flexner C, Parsons T, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007, 45(2): 201-205. </em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and atazanavir were determined in 16 HIV+ subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and atazanavir (300 mg once daily). Values were compared to HIV+ historical controls receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=15), saquinavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (1000/400/100 mg twice daily, n=25) or atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily, n=15). Lopinavir plasma concentrations were higher when given with atazanavir, than when given alone or with saquinavir (AUC 115.7 vs 85.2 vs 85.1 &#181;g/ml.h; Cmax 12.2 vs 9.5 vs 10.0 &#181;g/ml; Cmin 9.1 vs 5.6 vs 5.5 &#181;g/ml). No difference was observed when atazanavir was given with lopinavir/ritonavir vs alone for AUC (48.2 vs 45.2 &#181;g/ml.h) and Cmax (3.95 vs 4.44 &#181;g/ml); however Cmin was higher when given with lopinavir/ritonavir (1.07 vs 0.58 &#181;g/ml). The increase in atazanavir Cmin is likely to be due to the additional dose of ritonavir when given twice daily with lopinavir. <br /><em>Atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir: pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of a promising double-boosted protease inhibitor regimen.

<p>The effect of adding lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) to atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) or adding atazanavir (300 mg once daily) to lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was investigated in HIV-infected subjects. For patients initially receiving atazanavir/ritonavir once daily, ritonavir was stopped and lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily added, thus doubling the daily dose of ritonavir. The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir had no effect on atazanavir AUC (53899 vs 49197 ng/ml.h, alone vs combination), Cmax (3996 vs 3425 ng/ml) or Cmin (860 vs 796 ng/ml). The addition of atazanavir to lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in non-significant decreases in lopinavir AUC (85415 vs 70057 ng/ml.h,. alone vs combination) and Cmax (9096 vs 7505 ng/ml), but significantly decreased lopinavir Cmin (4049 vs 2840 ng/ml).

<p>HIV+ subjects taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) added in atazanavir (300 mg once daily) on day 1 and pharmacokinetics over 12 hours were determined on day 7. Atazanavir was then stopped and after a 14-day washout, pharmacokinetic sampling for lopinavir repeated. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly different when lopinavir was taken with or without atazanavir.

                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

Given that low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) has been shown to have no significant effect on methadone concentrations, no interaction is expected if methadone is co-administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, based on these data.

<p>No clinically significant interaction was observed when atazanavir was coadministered with methadone. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) to 16 subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy resulted in decreases in total methadone Cmax (15%) and AUC (6%) and a 2% increase in Cmin. Cmax of the active isomer, R-methadone, was decreased by 9%; AUC increased by 3% and Cmin increased by 11%. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and methadone was studied in 16 HIV-negative subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy. Pharmacokinetic parameters for R-methadone (the active enantiomer) and S-methadone (the inactive enantiomer) were dose-normalised as part of data analysis. Pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were compared with those from historical controls not treated with methadone, and from both HIV+ and HIV= subjects. Atazanavir increased AUC and Cmin of active R-methadone by 3% and 11% respectively; Cmax decreased by 9%. Confidence intervals for all three R-methadone parameters were within the no-effect or bioequivalence range of 0.80-1.25. Exposure of S-methadone was reduced in the presence of atazanavir (AUC by 15%, Cmax by 21% and Cmin by 10%). Total methadone AUC and Cmax decreased by 6% and 15% respectively, with Cmin increasing by 2%. No clinically relevant symptoms of opiate withdrawal or excess were detected. Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were 20237 ng/ml.h, 3777 ng/ml and 143 ng/ml, respectively and were within the range of values reported previously from studies with HIV+ and HIV- subjects. <br /><em>Lack of an effect of atazanavir on steady-state pharmacokinetics of methadone in patients chronically treated for opiate addiction.

Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration with ORAL midazolam is contraindicated. Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of ORAL midazolam with atazanavir may cause large increases in midazolam concentrations. Potential for serious and/or life-threatening events such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. Concomitant use of PARENTERAL midazolam with atazanavir may increase plasma concentrations of midazolam. Coadministration should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p></span>

A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form.

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

<p>The influence of nevirapine on atazanavir trough concentrations (Ctrough) was studied in a group of HIV-infected patients (n=11) receiving 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir once daily for 2 weeks or longer. Nevirapine was added at a dose of 200 mg once daily from Days 0 to 14 and 200 mg twice daily from Days 14 to 28. Atazanavir and nevirapine plasma Ctroughs were determined at Days 0 and 28. The geometric mean atazanavir Ctrough decreased from 0.631 mg/L (range, 0.235-1.87 mg/L) at Day 0 to 0.316 mg/L (range, 0.142-1.109 mg/L) at Day 28 to give a geometric mean ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.80; P = 0.026); nonetheless, the atazanavir Ctrough remained higher than the minimum effective concentration in 80% of the participants and higher than the median concentration in historical control subjects receiving 400 mg atazanavir once daily without ritonavir (GMR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.65-6.22; P = 0.001). The authors conclude that monitoring atazanavir Ctrough is recommended in patients treated with this drug combination, and increasing the atazanavir dose might be necessary. <br /><em>Effect of nevirapine on the steady-state trough concentrations of atazanavir in HIV-infected patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir.

<p>Trough concentrations were obtained from 16 patients receiving nevirapine once daily (400 mg) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg, n=7; 400/100 mg n=9). Median atazanavir trough concentrations were 340 ng/ml and 520 ng/ml for the 300 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively; values obtained from historical controls receiving 300/100 mg were 610 ng/ml. Nevirapine trough concentrations were 3900 ng/ml and 4000 ng/ml for the two groups and were comparable to literature values for patients treated with nevirapine alone (3700 ng/ml). Given the decrease in atazanavir trough concentrations, relative to historical controls, therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir may be appropriate for patients (especially if treatment experienced) receiving this combination. <br /><em>Plasma concentrations of atazanavir in HIV patients treated with regimens including nevirapine.

<p>Steady state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazananavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. <br /><em>Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

<p>Use with caution if coadministration of atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir with oral contraceptives is considered. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with ethinylestradiol and norethindrone, in 19 subjects, caused a 15%, 48% and 91% increase in ethinylestradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively; norethindrone Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 1.67-, 2.1- and a 3.62-fold, respectively. If an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. If atazanavir is administered without ritonavir, the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Potential safety risks include substantial increases in progesterone exposure.

If an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30 microgram of ethinylestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen.

If the combination of atazanavir with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded. Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) 2 hours before atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 61%, 66% and 65%, respectively. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg once daily) 1 hour before an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 30%, 31% and 31%, relative to atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) without omeprazole. The decrease in AUC, Cmax and Cmin was not mitigated when an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with proton pump inhibitors.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em></div><br /></p><div>Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg or atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients, the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose. In treatment-experienced adult patients, the use of PPIs in treatment-experienced patients receiving atazanavir is not recommended. Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) and atazanavir (400 mg once daily) to 16 subjects resulted decreases of ~95% in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin. Omeprazole Cmax increased by 24% and AUC increased by 45%. When omeprazole (40 mg once daily) was coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) to 15 subjects, atazanavir Cmax decreased by 72%, AUC decreased by 76% and Cmin decreased by 78%. Administration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) 12 hours apart from omeprazole (20 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 39%, 42% and 46% respectively. Relative to atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily), atazanavir geometric mean AUC increased 10% and Cmin increased 2.4-fold; Cmax decreased 29%. Administration of atazanavir (400/100 mg once daily) 12 hours apart from omeprazole (20 mg once daily) resulted in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin that were ~30% lower than when atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg were administered alone. Relative to atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily), atazanavir geometric mean AUC increased 32% and Cmin increased 3.3-fold; Cmax decreased 26%.</div><div><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></div>
<p>The effect of a lower dose of omeprazole (20 mg) on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 or 400/100 mg once daily) when given with omeprazole either simultaneously or 12 h apart was studied in groups of HIV- subjects (n=14 per group). When atazanavir was dosed in the evening, giving omeprazole 12 h apart, decreased atazanavir Cmax (39%), AUC (42%) and Cmin (46%); giving omeprazole 12 h apart and increasing atazanavir to 400 mg decreased atazanavir Cmax (29%), AUC (28%) and Cmin (24%). When atazanavir was dosed in the morning, giving omeprazole 1 h prior to atazanavir and increasing atazanavir to 400 mg decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin all by ~30%; giving omeprazole 12 h apart and increasing atazanavir to 400 mg, decreased atazanavir Cmax (20%), AUC (29%) and Cmin (37%). When compared to concentrations obtained with ATV 400 mg alone, all atazanavir + omeprazole combinations resulted in comparable atazanavir AUCs and ~2-fold increases in Cmin. Despite increasing atazanavir to 400 mg, when given with omeprazole atazanavir exposure was decreased by ~30% (relative to 300/100 mg alone) with the effect of omeprazole being similar when given either 1 h before or 12 h apart from ATV. <br /><em>Effect of omeprazole 20 mg daily on the bioavailability of multiple-dose atazanavir with ritonavir in healthy subjects.

<p>Atazanavir trough concentrations (24 &#177; 4 h post dose) were determined in 13 HIV+ patients receiving either atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily) with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole n=10, rabeprazole n=3) and in 79 HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir alone. Median (range) atazanavir concentrations were 551 (203-1976) ng/ml in the presence of a PPI and 469 (65-1944) ng/ml when given alone.<br /><em>Lack of interaction between atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors in HIV-infected patients treated with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir.

<p>An interaction study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily given in the morning) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/200 mg once daily given in the morning) alone and in combination with 20 mg of omeprazole once daily (given in the evening) was performed in 19 healthy adult volunteers. Full 24-hour pharmacokinetic analysis was performed before and 7 days into the omeprazole treatment. Each study subject took both PIs under the same conditions and therefore each subject acted as their own control. The addition of 20 mg omeprazole as an evening regimen did not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics with geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24 all close to 1. In contrast, atazanavir pharmacokinetics were significantly altered with reductions of 27%, 33% and 27% for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC respectively. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of once daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) and atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) alone and in combination with 20 mg once daily of omeprazole (OMP) in healthy volunteers.

<p>The effect of the proton pump omeprazole (40 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg alone or with cola, 400/100 mg alone) was investigated in healthy subjects. Atazanavir exposures were substantially reduced with omeprazole in all three groups: Cmin decreased from 1366 ng/ml to 285, 330, 423 ng/ml, Cmax decreased from 5460 to 1522, 1840, 2388 ng/ml and AUC decreased from 60797 to 14605, 18325, 23968 ng/ml.h. Omeprazole exposures were generally comparable to literature values and were similar between groups. Proton pump inhibitors should not be used in patients on atazanavir/ritonavir regimens when atazanavir exposures similar to a boosted atazanavir regimen are required. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic effect of omeprazole on atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir in healthy subjects.

<p>Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 1.85 &#181;g/ml) compared to 1.12 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 3.17 &#181;g/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 &#181;g/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted. <br /><em>Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

Coadministration of omeprazole (40 mg once daily) 2 hours before atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 61%, 66% and 65%, respectively. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg once daily) 1 hour before an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 30%, 31% and 31%, relative to atazanavir and ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) without omeprazole. The decrease in AUC, Cmax and Cmin was not mitigated when an increased dose of atazanavir and ritonavir (400/100 mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. Although not studied, similar results are expected with other proton pump inhibitors. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric pH increases with proton pump inhibitors.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em><br /><br />Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg or atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. In treatment-naive adult patients, the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose. In treatment-experienced adult patients, the use of PPIs in treatment-experienced patients receiving atazanavir is not recommended.<br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em><br /></div></span>

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

Long term use of pethidine and atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended due to the increased concentration of norpethidine which may increase the risk of seizures.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

<p>A phase I, open-label, randomized, cross-over drug interaction study in healthy volunteers assessed the pharmacokinetic effect of coadministering posaconazole (400 mg twice daily) and atazanavir (300 mg once daily) alone and with ritonavir (100 mg once daily). Posaconazole increased atazanavir Cmax and AUC by 2.6-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively. In the presence of ritonavir, posaconazole increased atazanavir Cmax and AUC by 1.5-fold and 2.-5-fold, respectively; i.e. there was additional inhibition (possibly of CYP3A4 or other enzymes/transporters) of posaconazole and ritonavir over either drug on its own. Posaconazole plasma concentrations were comparable for both dosing regimens. Most subjects who received atazanavir (with and without ritonavir) and posaconazole experienced clinically relevant increases in total bilirubin. Frequent monitoring of adverse events and toxicity related to antiviral exposure is recommended in the event of coadministration of posaconazole and atazanavir (with and without ritonavir). <br /><em>Effects of oral posaconazole on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir alone and with ritonavir or with efavirenz in healthy adult volunteers.

Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect.

<p>Praziquantel is metabolised in part by CYP3A4. Data with ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, showed a significant increase in exposure to praziquantel when co-administered: A crossover study in 10 healthy subjects suggested that the CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitor ketoconazole almost doubled exposure to, and mean peak plasma concentration of, praziquantel when both drugs were given together. <br /><em>Ridtitid W, et al.

The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 by atazanavir/ritonavir. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis.

                    <span>Pyridostigmine bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterases and is also metabolised in the liver. Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

A 57-year-old male with HIV and bipolar disease developed rapid and severe weight gain when quetiapine was added to a stable atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen. After discontinuation of both quetiapine and ritonavir, his weight returned to its baseline value. The second patient (32-year-old female with HIV, anxiety disorder, and a history of intravenous drug abuse) developed increased sedation and mental confusion when an atazanavir/ritonavir-based antiretroviral regimen was added to her stable anti-anxiety drug regimen, which included quetiapine. Her symptoms resolved promptly after discontinuation of the quetiapine. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the adverse effects experienced by the two patients were possibly related and probably related, respectively, to an interaction between quetiapine and atazanavir/ritonavir.

<div>The pharmacokinetic interaction between raltegravir (a substrate of UGT1A1) and atazanavir (an inhibitor of UGT1A1) was investigated in HIV- subjects. Coadministration of raltegravir (100 mg single dose) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 7 days) increased raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 72%, 53% and 95%, respectively. When the recommend dose of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) was given with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), raltegravir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 41%, 24% and 77%, respectively.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of raltegravir were determined in 19 HIV- subjects following administration of raltegravir alone (400 mg twice daily) or raltegravir/atazanavir (400/400 mg once daily). High inter-individual variability was observed along with significant intra-individual diurnal variation when given twice daily. Despite a significant reduction in raltegravir-glucuronide concentrations, atazanavir did not significantly increase raltegravir concentrations. When given twice daily, geometric mean raltegravir trough concentration, Cmax and AUC were 40 ng/ml, 1016 ng/ml and 3934 ng/ml.h), respectively. When given once daily with atazanavir, raltegravir trough concentration, Cmax and AUC were 1402 ng/ml (37% increase), 13 ng/ml (67% decrease) and 5541 ng/ml.h, respectively. Although atazanavir inhibited the UDP-glucuronyl-transferase-1A1 mediated metabolism of raltegravir, trough concentrations of raltegravir were significantly lower when given once daily with atazanavir than when given twice daily alone. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of once daily raltegravir and atazanavir in healthy volunteers.

Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if H2-receptor antagonists are administered with atazanavir.

In summary they state:<br /><p>&#8226; H2-RAs increase intragastric pH and reduce atazanavir absorption. However,<br />&#8226; H2-RAs are less potent than proton pump inhibitors in suppressing intragastric pH and may be used with atazanavir. <br />&#8226; Atazanavir/ritonavir at 300/100 mg may be used concomitantly with H2-RAs although temporal separation (giving ATV/r 10 hours after or 2 hours before the H2-RA) should be considered in treatment experienced patients. <br />&#8226; Local prescribing information may vary.<br />Based on current data the above approach to managing the interaction is appropriate although some may feel that temporal separation of the H2-RA and atazanavir/ritonavir would be safer in all patients. Note: The authors clearly state that due to the magnitude of the decrease in exposure, atazanavir should NOT be used concomitantly with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). <br /><em>Further information on the administration of H2-receptor antagonists with atazanavir.

<p>Trough atazanavir concentrations were available in 15 patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 19 patients receiving an H2 receptor antagonist (H2). The mean atazanavir trough concentration in the PPI group was 0.65 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 1.85 &#181;g/ml) compared to 1.12 &#181;g/ml (range &lt;0.05 to 3.17 &#181;g/ml) in the H2 group. Concentrations were below target (0.27 &#181;g/ml) in 6/15 in the PPI group, even though 5 of these were receiving boosted atazanavir. Inadequate levels were observed in 4/20 in the H2 group, 2 of whom were receiving boosted atazanavir. These results suggest a negative effect of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists on atazanavir concentrations and that boosting with ritonavir does not ensure adequate concentrations. Further study of this important issue is warranted. <br /><em>Coadministration of atazanavir with proton-pump inhibitors and H2-blockers.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

                      <span>Coadministration of atazanavir and rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on atazanavir exposure, whereas initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed a significant increase in rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) concentrations. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and rifabutin (150 mg 3 times a week) resulted in rifabutin Cmax and Ctrough concentrations below the therapeutic levels suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg 3 times a week and atazanavir/r or lopinavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).</span>

The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin increased by 10.90-fold, 7.77-fold and 11.45-fold. In previous studies, the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were not altered by rifabutin. When given with atazanavir/ritonavir, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday-Wednesday-Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for atazanavir/ritonavir.<br />

<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (600 mg once daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) resulted in increases in rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 1.18-, 2.10- and 3.43-fold respectively (n=3); Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin were increased by 8.20-, 22.01- and 75.6-fold respectively. When atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and rifabutin (150 mg once daily) were coadministered (n=7), the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of atazanavir were increased by 1.34-, 1.15- and 1.13-fold respectively. A rifabutin dose reduction of up to 75% (e.g., 150 mg every other rifabutin day or 3 times per week) is recommended. <br />

<div>The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) when given in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir was studied in 16 HIV/TB coinfected patients. Peak rifabutin concentrations were below the lower therapeutic limit (&lt;0.3 &#956;g/ml) in seven patients, while ten patients had trough concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (0.06 &#956;g/ml), suggesting that the rifabutin dosage may be inadequate.</div>

<p>In parallel groups, subjects received rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone (n&#8202;=&#8202;15, reference group) or rifabutin 150 mg twice weekly with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily, n&#8202;=&#8202;18, test group). Blood samples were collected at steady-state for pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters for rifabutin and 25-O-desacteyl rifabutin increased when rifabutin was co-administered twice weekly with atazanavir/ritonavir compared to rifabutin 150 mg once daily alone. (rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 149%, 48% and 40%, respectively; 25-O-desacteyl rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 6.77-, 9.90- and 10.45-fold, respectively). The study was stopped because subjects experienced more severe declines in neutrophil counts when rifabutin was given with atazanavir/ritonavir than alone. However, a post-hoc simulation analysis showed that when rifabutin 150 mg was given three times weekly with atazanavir/ritonavir, the average daily exposure of rifabutin was comparable to rifabutin 300 mg once daily, a dose necessary for reducing rifamycin resistance in HIV/TB co-infected patients. The benefits to HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg three times weekly or every other day may outweigh the risks of neutropenia observed here in non-HIV-infected subjects, provided that patients on combination therapy will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability. Further studies of rifabutin in combination with PIs in healthy subjects should be avoided.<br />

<div>The effect of rifabutin (150 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) was studied in 7 healthy subjects. Atazanavir exposure following coadministration was comparable to that achieved alone; Cmax increased from 3551 to 4770 ng/ml and AUC increased from 22107 to 25369 ng/ml (alone vs combination). The AUC of rifabutin in this study was 7694 ng/ml.h and was higher than reported in the literature for the usual 300 mg once daily dose. A standard 400 mg dose of atazanavir is recommended for concomitant administration with rifabutin. Rifabutin dose reduction by up to 75% (e.g., 150 mg every other rifabutin day or 3 times per week) may be appropriate for coadministration with atazanavir.&nbsp;</div></div><div>

                    <span><p>The combination of rifampicin and atazanavir with concomitant low-dose ritonavir is contraindicated. Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause a 72% decrease in atazanavir AUC which can result in virological failure and resistance development. During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of atazanavir or other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>
<p>Rifampicin substantially decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) to 16 subjects resulted in decreases in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 53%, 72% and 98% respectively. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<p>A phase 1, open-label, one-arm (with 3 sequential periods) study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetic interactions and safety of atazanavir, ritonavir and rifampicin in 14 HIV- volunteers. During period 1, participants received rifampicin (600 mg once daily) for 8 days. During period 2, participants continued the same dose of rifampicin and added atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) for at least 11 days. During period 3, atazanavir was to be increased to 400 mg twice daily. However, on adding atazanavir/ritonavir, the first 3 subjects developed vomiting and transaminase elevations resulting in study drug discontinuation. The study was therefore terminated. The authors concluded that coadministration of rifampicin with protease inhibitors may not be a viable treatment option if rifampicin administration precedes protease inhibitor initiation. <br /><em>Hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal intolerance when healthy volunteers taking rifampin add twice-daily atazanavir and ritonavir.

<p>Pharmacokinetics of steady-state atazanavir and ritonavir were evaluated in three HIV/TB co-infected patients treated with a rifampicin-containing regimen (rifampicin 600 mg per day) and antiretroviral therapy including NRTIs plus atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily).. Data were compared to historical data for atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily). In all three cases there was a marked decrease in exposure (median of 64% compared to atazanavir alone) and for more than 50% of the time the atazanavir level was below the minimum recommended trough plasma level (150 ng/ml according to current pharmacokinetic guidelines) to inhibit HIV wild-type replication. The administration of rifampicin with a combination of atazanavir/ritonavir must be avoided because subtherapeutic concentrations of atazanavir are produced. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between rifampicin and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir in HIV-infected patients.

<p>The safety and pharmacokinetic interaction of atazanavir and rifampicin were assessed in 10 healthy volunteers receiving atazanavir (300 mg twice daily) alone (period 1) or with rifampicin (600 mg once daily; period 2), or atazanavir (400 mg twice daily) with rifampicin (600 mg once daily; period 3). Despite the twice daily administration of atazanavir, the mean C12h values for atazanavir were 44 ng/ml (period 2) and 113 ng/ml (period 3) which were markedly below those seen in period 1 (811 ng/ml) or historical data from atazanavir 400 mg once daily. The authors speculate that a strategy that warrants further investigation is to combine atazanavir (either 300 or 400 mg) with ritonavir (100 mg) both given twice daily with rifampicin once daily. <br /><em>Effect of concomitantly administered rifampin on the pharmacokinetics and safety of atazanavir administered twice daily.

<p>The magnitude of the interaction between rifampicin and unboosted atazanavir given twice daily was studied in 10 HIV- subjects. Coadministration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily) and atazanavir (300 mg twice daily) decreased atazanavir AUC (80%), Cmax (66%) and Cmin (95%). Increasing atazanavir to 400 mg twice daily with rifampicin decreased atazanavir AUC (59%), Cmax (41%) and Cmin (86%) compared to atazanavir 300 mg alone. Although safe and generally well tolerated, neither atazanavir regimen maintained adequate plasma exposure when given with rifampicin. <br /><em>Effect of rifampin on pharmacokinetics and safety of twice-daily atazanavir: ACTG Protocol A5213.

<p>A study was conducted in 71 healthy subjects to investigate the interaction with atazanavir/ritonavir and rifampicin. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily) or atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) were determined at steady state. Pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100, 300/200 or 400/200 mg once daily) with rifampicin (600 mg once daily) were determined following 10 days of dosing. Significant decreases in atazanavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin, were observed with all dosing regimens. Rifampicin and desacetyl-rifampicin exposures were comparable across the different regimens of atazanavir/ritonavir, but were 1-6- to 2.5-fold higher than when given alone. Coadministration of atazanavir with rifampicin was safe and generally well tolerated. However, as atazanavir exposures were reduced in all regimens, these two agents should not be co-administered at the dosages studied.<br /><em>Effect of rifampin on steady-state pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and ritonavir in healthy subjects.

                    <span><p>Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Ritonavir 100 mg once daily is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics. In a combined analysis, atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg (n=33, HIV+) was compared to atazanavir 400 mg without ritonavir (n=28). Atazanavir AUC increased by 250%, Cmax increased by 120% and Cmin increased by 713%. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and ritonavir is CYP3A4 inhibition. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg once daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) increased the atazanavir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin by 1.86, 3.38 and 11.89-fold, respectively. If atazanavir is coadministered with ritonavir, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg once daily be given with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<p>Atazanavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: atazanavir 300 mg daily with ritonavir 100 mg daily. Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200mg once daily could be considered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted. Refer to the Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics for further details. Coadministration of atazanavir (300 mg once daily) and ritonavir (100 mg once daily) increased atazanavir AUC by 86% and Cmin by 11-fold. Based on cross-study comparison to atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily), atazanavir AUC increased 2-fold and Cmin increased 3-7 fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of atazanavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of 300 mg atazanavir once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in treatment experienced patients. Ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as atazanavir) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir. Norvir should be used with caution in such patients. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of atazanavir and ritonavir, atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased. Atazanavir plamsa concentrations achieved with atazanavir 300 mg qd and ritonavir 100 mg qd are higher than those achieved with atazanavir 400 mg qd. See the complete Prescribing Information for atazanavir for details on co-administration of atazanavir 300 mg qd with ritonavir 100 mg qd. The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended. Patients should consult their physician if they experience symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, abnormal heart rhythm, or loss of consciousness. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p></span>

<div>Coadministration of salmeterol with atazanavir is not recommended. Concomitant use of salmeterol and atazanavir may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia.<br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.<br /><br /></em>Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risk of systemic side effects of salmeterol treatment. Concomitant use of systemic ketoconazole significantly increases systemic exposure to salmeterol. This may lead to an increase in the incidence of systemic effects (e.g. prolongation in the QTc interval and palpitations). Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once daily) and salmeterol (50 mcg inhaled twice daily) in 15 healthy subjects for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure (1.4-fold Cmax and 15-fold AUC). Clinically significant effects were not seen on blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose and blood potassium levels. Co-administration with ketoconazole did not increase the elimination half-life of salmeterol or increase salmeterol accumulation with repeat dosing. There is likely to be a similar risk of interaction with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, ritonavir). <br /><em>Serevent (salmeterol) Summary of Product Characteristics, Allen &amp; Hanburys, December 2009.</em></div>
<p>Due to the potential increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events, the concomitant use of salmeterol with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) is not recommended. In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction study in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76; 90% CI: 10.66, 23.31) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta agonist&#8211;mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. <br /><em>Serevent (salmeterol) Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, March 2008.</em></p></span>

<p>Steady state plasma concentrations of atazanavir, saquinavir and ritonavir were obtained from 40 HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily).

Atazanavir exposure was higher in the triple PI group than in the atazanavir/ritonavir group (AUC 48383 vs 37583 ng/ml.h, Cmax 4625 vs 3295 ng/ml, Cmin 584 vs 584 ng/ml). In the triple PI group (vs saquinavir/ritonavir group), saquinavir AUC and Cmin decreased (AUC 25931 vs 35928 ng/ml.h, Cmin 384 vs 437 ng/ml), however Cmax increased (3735 vs 2805 ng/ml).

<p>The elimination half-lives of saquinavir were determined following various doses and dosing regimens of saquinavir/ritonavir alone and with fosamprenavir or atazanavir. No significant change in saquinavir half-life was observed when comparing different doses and dosing regimens, with the exception of the atazanavir containing regimen (saquinavir/ritonavir/atazanavir 1600/100/300 mg once daily). This showed a significantly higher saquinavir half-life when compared to that obtained with saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily (4.49 vs 3.23 h). Saquinavir half-life is independent of saquinavir dose, ritonavir dosing intervals or presence of fosamprenavir. Atazanavir significantly increases saquinavir elimination half-life, suggesting that atazanavir has an additional impact on saquinavir elimination compared to the administration of ritonavir alone. <br /><em>Atazanavir but not ritonavir impacts the elimination half-life of saquinavir hard gel in HIV+ subjects.

<div><strong>Unboosted Saquinavir/Atazanavir<br /></strong>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/atazanavir combinations given twice daily were investigated in 16 HIV- subjects and compared to data obtained when saquinavir was given with low dose ritonavir. Saquinavir/atazanavir 1500/200 mg twice daily led to the achievement of saquinavir concentrations which were significantly lower than those measured in the presence of low dose ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily). However, the median (range) saquinavir Cmin measured was 129 (12-425) ng/ml, with 75% of the subjects showing concentrations higher than the suggested threshold of 100 ng/ml. Interestingly, atazanavir Cmax was 55% lower and Cmin 96% higher than those measured when atazanavir is administered at a dose of 400 mg once daily. Saquinavir did not alter atazanavir plasma concentrations. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of saquinavir with low-dose ritonavir or atazanavir twice daily in seronegative volunteers: ASPIRE II.

<div>The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir/ritonavir (1600/100 mg once daily) and saquinavir/atazanavir (1600/400 or 2000/400 mg once daily) were investigated in healthy volunteers. Saquinavir median pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly higher with ritonavir (Cmax 3783 ng.ml, Cmin 87 ng/ml, AUC 26.79 mg/L.h) than with atazanavir (SQV 1600 mg, Cmax 1519 ng.ml, Cmin &lt;25 ng/ml, AUC 7.06 mg/L.h; SQV 2000 mg Cmax 2500 ng.ml, Cmin 30 ng/ml, AUC 10.61 mg/L.h).

Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.

Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces.

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.<br /><em>Norvir&#174; (Ritonavir) 100mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

                    <span><div><div>In a combined analysis from several clinical studies in HIV+  subjects, atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg co-administered with tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (n=39) was compared to atazanavir/ritonavir  300/100 mg (n=33). Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 22%, 16%  and 23%, respectively. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 37%,  34% and 29%, respectively. The efficacy of atazanavir/ritonavir in  combination with tenofovir in treatment-experienced patients has been  demonstrated in clinical study 045 and in treatment naive patients in  clinical study 138. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and  tenofovir is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored for  tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. During  the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, if tenofovir is  needed, a  dose increase to atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with  TDM may  be considered. If atazanavir/ritonavir with tenofovir or an  H2-receptor  antagonist are co-administered during the second and third trimesters  of pregnancy,  a dose increase of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of  ritonavir is  recommended. It is not recommended to use atazanavir with  ritonavir for  pregnant patients who are receiving both tenofovir and an  H2-receptor  antagonist.<br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2014.</em><br /><br />Atazanavir  without ritonavir should not be coadministered with tenofovir.  Tenofovir may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When  coadministered with tenofovir in adults, it is recommended that  atazanavir 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir 300 mg  (all as a single daily dose with food). Increase atazanavir/ritonavir to  400/100 mg once daily in treatment-experienced patients receiving both  tenofovir and a H2-receptor antagonist. For treatment-experienced  pregnant patients during the second or third trimester receiving  tenofovir, increase atazanavir/ritonavir to 400/100 mg once daily. There  are insufficient data to recommend an atazanavir dose for use with both  an H2-receptor antagonist and tenofovir in treatment-experienced  pregnant women. Atazanavir increases tenofovir concentrations. The  mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher tenofovir  concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions,  including renal disorders. Patients receiving atazanavir and tenofovir  should be monitored for tenofovir- associated adverse reactions.  Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with tenofovir (300  mg once daily), in 34 subjects, caused a 21%, 25% and 40% decrease in  atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively; tenofovir Cmax, AUC and  Cmin increased by 14%, 24% and 22%, respectively. When  atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was coadministered with  tenofovir (300 mg once daily), in 10 subjects, decreases of 28%, 25% and  23% in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively, were observed  (compared to atazanavir/ritonavir without tenofovir). The geometric mean  values for atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, when coadministered with  ritonavir and tenofovir, were 3190 ng/ml, 34459 ng.h/ml and 491 ng/ml,  respectively. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em><br /></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Coadministration  of atazanvir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg  once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC (25%), Cmax (28%) and Cmin (26%).  Tenofovir AUC increased by 37%, Cmax increased by 34% and Cmin increased  by 29%. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of  tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events,  including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored.</div><div><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em></div> <p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 14 days) and  tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) to 33 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax  (14%), AUC (24%) and Cmin (22%). Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin  decreased by 21%, 25% and 40% respectively. Coadministration of  tenofovir-DF and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 42  days) increased tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 34%, 37% and 29%,  respectively; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 28%, 25%, and  23%, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, addition of tenofovir-DF to  atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, resulted in AUC and Cmin  values of atazanavir that were 2.3- and 4-fold higher than the  respective values observed for atazanavir 400 mg when given alone. When  coadministered with tenofovir-DF, it is recommended that atazanavir 300  mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Tenofovir-DF should not be  coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Patients receiving  tenofovir-DF concomitantly with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should be  monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir-DF  should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated  adverse reactions. <br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, May 2015.</em></p> <p>Atazanavir trough concentrations were determined in 43 HIV+ subjects  receiving unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) in the presence of  tenofovir-DF. The median trough concentration was 242 (range 106-1100)  ng/ml with 8 subjects having low trough concentrations (&lt;150 ng/ml).  Following a dose increase to 600 mg once daily in 4/8 subjects,  atazanavir trough concentrations were 222-294 ng/ml. Viral load results  were available for 36 subjects, 31 of whom were undetectable (&lt;50  copies/ml) at baseline. 30 remained &lt;50 copies/ml and all were  &lt;100 copies/ml at last follow up. Five subjects had viral loads  &gt;50 copies/ml at baseline, of whom 3 were undetectable at last follow  up. <br /><em>Atazanavir trough levels in patients receiving unboosted  atazanavir and tenofovir. Harris M, Hull M, Toy J, et al. 10th  International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy,  Amsterdam, April 2009, abstract P21.</em></p> <p>The pharmacokinetic effects of the coadministration of tenofovir-DF  (300 mg once daily) and unboosted atazanavir was studied in HIV-negative  subjects. A dosing strategy that would provide atazanavir and tenofovir  exposures comparable to each drug when dosed alone was evaluated. The  strategies employed were dosing the ATV (400 mg once daily) and TDF 12  hours apart and increasing the ATV dose to 600 mg once daily. The  temporal 12 hour separation of ATV 400 mg resulted in a decrease in ATV  Cmax, AUC, Cmin of 10%, 17%, and 28%, respectively and an increase in  TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 43%, 37%, and 38%, respectively. The  simultaneous administration of 600 mg ATV with TDF resulted in a  decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 27%, 36%, and 41%, respectively  and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 41%, 59%, and 74%,  respectively. Based on these findings the authors continue to recommend  that when co-dosed with TDF, ATV (300 mg once daily) should be combined  with RTV (100 mg once daily). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between  tenofovir and atazanavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala S, et al. 3rd  IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, Rio de Janiero, July  2005, abstract WePe3.3C07. </em></p> <p>A study was performed in healthy volunteers to determine whether  increasing ATV/RTV from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg once daily with TDF, or  maintaining the standard dose but separating administration of TDF by  12 h, could overcome the 25% decrease in ATV exposure previously seen  when coadministered with TDF. Relative to ATV/RTV 300/100, simultaneous  administration of ATV/RTV 400/100 resulted in increases in ATV AUC and  Cmin of 38% and 33% respectively. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 55% and  70% respectively. Maintaining the standard dose, but separating  administration by 12 h, resulted in an 11% decrease in ATV AUC and a 20%  decrease in Cmin. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 37% and 29%  respectively. RTV exposure was comparable across treatments. Due to the  increases in ATV and higher TDF exposures, coadministration of ATV/RTV  400/100 mg with TDF is not recommended. Separation of ATV/RTV 300/100 mg  and TDF doses is not expected to offer any additional clinical  advantage over simultaneous administration. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic  interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir coadministered with  ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International  Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005,  abstract 16.</em></p> <p>The pharmacokinetics of TDF (300 mg once daily) when given with  ATV/RTV (300/100 mg once daily) were assessed in a substudy of the  Puzzle2-ANRS 107 trial. Full PK profiles were determined in 10 patients:  median (range) TDF Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 234 (121-855) ng/ml, 45  (23-215) ng/ml and 2253 (1305-11285) ng/ml.h respectively. Trough  concentrations at weeks 6, 10, 18 and 26 were 58, 64, 53 and 57 ng/ml  respectively (n=32-38). Tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters were  comparable to historical data obtained from healthy and HIV+ subjects,  suggesting that tenofovir exposure is not substantially altered when  coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic  parameters of tenofovir when combined with atazanavir /ritonavir in HIV  infected patients with multiple treatment failures: a substudy of  Puzzle2- ANRS 107 trial. Taburet, A-M et al. 6th International Workshop  on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract  55.</em></p> <p>Steady state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients  taking atazananavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without  tenofovir-DF and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed  in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir  alone and those taking tenofovir-DF. There was a trend towards decreased  atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with  or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest  that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with  tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. <br /><em>Interaction  between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical  setting.

After the addition of tenofovir-DF, both atazanavir and  ritonavir exposure were reduced. Atazanavir Cmax decreased from 5233 &#177;  3033 to 3443 &#177; 1412 ng/ml (mean &#177; sd), AUC decreased from 53761 &#177; 35255  to 39276 &#177; 23034 ng/ml.h, and Cmin decreased from 862 &#177; 838 to 577 &#177; 367  ng/ml. <br /><em>Interactions between atazanavir-ritonavir and tenofovir  in heavily pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

Addition of tenofovir-DF decreased atazanavir Cmax,  AUC and Cmin (21%, 25% and 40% respectively); tenofovir Cmax, AUC and  Cmin were increased by 1.14-, 1.24- and 1.22-fold respectively in the  presence of atazanavir. In the presence of tenofovir-DF and ddI-EC (250  mg once daily with food), atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by  24%, 26% and 39% respectively (compared to atazanavir alone); tenofovir  Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 1.12-, 1.25- and 1.25-fold respectively  (compared to tenofovir alone). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the  combination of atazanavir, enteric coated didanosine and tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate for a once daily antiretroviral regimen.

Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for atazanavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition.

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

At steady state, the decreases in atazanavir AUC and Cmin were larger, being 68% and 81% respectively. Co-administration of steady state atazanavir with steady state tipranavir/ritonavir resulted in increases in tipranavir AUC (20%) and Cmin (75%). The overall conclusion was that tipranavir/ritonavir has a marked impact on the PK of atazanavir and that co-administration of tipranavir/ritonavir 500/100 mg twice daily with atazanavir 300 mg once daily is not recommended. Since the licensed dose for tipranavir/ritonavir is 500/200 mg and not 500/100 mg the question of the impact of increased ritonavir remains conjecture. The increase in tipranavir Cmin in the presence of atazanavir is of interest and points to the additional boosting provided by atazanavir. <br /><em>The pharmacokinetic interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) and steady state tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) in healthy volunteers.

Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased atazanavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration of voriconazole and atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. The effect of atazanavir/ritonavir on voriconazole exposure is dependent on CYP2C19 metaboliser status. In extensive metabolisers (i.e. those with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele), coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and voriconazole decreased voriconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 33%, 10% and 39%, respectively; atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased 12%, 13% and 20%, respectively. In poor metaboliser subjects (i.e. those without a functional CYP2C19 allele), coadministration increased voriconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 5.6-, 4.4- and 7.7-fold, respectively, with atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreasing by 20%, 19% and 31%, respectively. Ritonavir exposures were generally unchanged in either population.  If coadministration is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for voriconazole-associated adverse reactions and loss of either voriconazole or atazanavir efficacy. The European SPC for atazanavir recommends a patient's CYP2C19 genotype should be performed if feasible. No data are available for coadministration of voriconazole with unboosted atazanavir, but atazanavir concentrations may be increased. </span>

In the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. Coadministration of voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was studied in subjects with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele. Voriconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 33%, 10% and 39%, respectively. Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 12%, 13% and 20%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 12%, 9% and 25%, respectively. In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected. At the time voriconazole treatment is required, a patient's CYP2C19 genotype should be performed if feasible. Therefore if the combination is unavoidable, the following recommendations are made according to the CYP2C19 status. In patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical monitoring for a loss of both voriconazole (clinical signs) and atazanavir (virologic response) efficacy is recommended. In patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of voriconazole-associated adverse events is recommended.

<div><div><div>The use of voriconazole in patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. Patients should be carefully monitored for voriconazole-associated adverse reactions and loss of either voriconazole or atazanavir efficacy during the coadministration of voriconazole and atazanavir/ritonavir. Coadministration of voriconazole with atazanavir (without ritonavir) may affect atazanavir concentrations; however, no data are available. Coadministration of voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) to subjects with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele (n=20) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 13%, 12% and 20%, respectively. Voriconazole Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 10%, 33% and 39% respectively. Coadministration of voriconazole (50 mg twice daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) to subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele (n=9) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 19%, 20% and 31%, respectively.

<div>Voriconazole is mainly metabolized by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Due to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19, voriconazole AUC is on average 2-4 fold higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers (PM) than in extensive metabolisers (EM). In a majority CYP2C19 EM population low dose ritonavir decreased voriconazole AUC by ~40%, likely due to induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. This study assessed the two-way drug interactions when adding voriconazole to atazanavir/ritonavir in both CYP2C19 EM and PM&nbsp; healthy subjects. Voriconazole was administered alone on days 1-3, atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100mg once daily) administered alone on days 11-20, and the drugs coadministered on days 21-30. The voriconazole doses were 200 mg twice daily (400 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for EM subjects and 50 mg twice daily (100 mg twice daily on days 1 and 21) for PM subjects. 20 EM and 7 PM subjects completed the study. In EM subjects, coadministration decreased voriconazole AUC and Cmin by 33% and 39%, respectively; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased 12% and 20%, respectively. In PM subjects, coadministration increased voriconazole Cmax and AUC by 4-6 fold; atazanavir AUC and Cmin decreased by 20% and 31%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC were generally unchanged in either population. The decrease in voriconazole AUC seen in EM subjects, (33%) is similar to the historical observation of 39% when voriconazole was given with low dose ritonavir. In PM subjects, coadministration markedly increased voriconazole exposure, likely through inhibition of CYP3A4. These results support the current recommendation that coadministration is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole.<br /><em>CYP2C19 genotype-dependent pharmacokinetic drug interaction between voriconazole and ritonavir boosted atazanavir in healthy subjects.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. The US Prescribing information for ziprasidone contraindicates its use in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential of life threatening arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4).
