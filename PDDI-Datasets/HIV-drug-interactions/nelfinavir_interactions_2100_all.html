Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated in the body, mostly in the liver by the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Much of a dose of adrenaline is excreted as metabolites in urine. The plasma half-life is about 2-3 minutes.

Within 2 weeks after the initiation of albendazole therapy, marked pancytopenia (hemoglobin of 5.8 mg/dl, thrombocytopenia of 13 g/l and neutropenia of 0.33 g/l) were observed. Full recovery of the bone marrow occurred within 10 weeks, after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. HAART was changed to stavudine 40mg BD, abacavir 300mg BD, and lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100mg BD. Antihelmintic therapy was continued with mebendazole, and plasma levels were monitored. Mebendazole dose requirements were stabilised at one tenth of those normally used to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations. Although albendazole serum concentrations were not measured, the authors advise caution when administering albendazole or mebendazole with CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs such as protease inhibitors.<br /><em>Alveolar echinococcosis of the liver in an adult with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

<p>Co-administration of nelfinavir with inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., amitriptyline) may be expected to reduce the conversion of nelfinavir to its major active metabolite M8 (tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir) with a concomitant increase in plasma nelfinavir levels. Limited clinical trial data from patients receiving one or more of these medicinal products with nelfinavir indicated that a clinically significant effect on safety and efficacy is not expected.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

A possible mechanism was suggested to be induction of glucuronidation by ritonavir. Nelfinavir can also induce glucuronidation and thus could potentially decrease atovaquone and proguanil. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis.

This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5.

However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Bedaquiline is metabolised by CYP3A4 and nelfinavir may increase bedaquiline exposure. The combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If coadministration is necessary, clinical monitoring including frequent electrocardiogram assessment and monitoring of transaminases is recommended. There are no clinical data on the safety and efficacy of bedaquiline when co-administered with antiretroviral agents.</span>

                    <span><p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominately by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to PPX, both mediated by cytochrome P4503A4. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

Nelfinavir pharmacokinetics and adverse effects were compared between the buprenorphine-maintained participants and a control group of non-opioid-dependent subjects (n=15) who received nelfinavir alone (1250 mg twice daily) alone. The coadministration of buprenorphine and nelfinavir did not result in significant pharmacokinetics changes for either compound and did not produce buprenorphine related side effects or withdrawal symptoms.

                    <span><p>Bupropion metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP2B6 and in vitro data has pointed to nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz being inhibitors of this enzyme. There is therefore potential for a drug interaction. This report is a case series aimed at documenting the clinical consequence of the co-administration of bupropion with nelfinavir, ritonavir, and efavirenz. The median duration of concomitant use was 8 months and ranged from 3 weeks to 2 years. There were no episodes of seizures documented in any of the medical records for patients who took bupropion with the CYP2B6 inhibitors. However, these data should be regarded as highly preliminary since: there is a low rate of seizure incidence in the literature, There were no PK measurements which are vital if we are to understand this interaction and no patients were receiving ritonavir at a dose above 100 mg bd. Further data are therefore required. <br /><em>Concurrent use of bupropion with CYP2B6 inhibitors, nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz: a case series. Park-Wyllie LY &amp; Antoniou T.

<p>The hydroxylation of bupropion was studied <em>in vitro</em> using human liver microsomes. It was concluded that ritonavir, efavirenz and nelfinavir inhibited CYP2B6 and therefore bupropion hydroxylation. The IC50 for nelfinavir was 2.5 &#181;M. This suggests that there is the potential for clinical drug interactions.<br /><em>Ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro: Potential drug interactions with bupropion.

<p>Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone or certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Consequently, when administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br />Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that chloramphenicol can inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Coadministration of chloramphenicol may potentially increase levels of nelfinavir via this mechanism, increasing the risk of adverse events. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown  Ocular use: Although chloramphenicol is systemically absorbed when used topically in the eye, the concentrations used are unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction. </span>

                    <span><div>The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Evidence suggests that chloramphenicol is absorbed systemically via topical ocular administration. Any chloramphenicol that is absorbed will be widely distributed in the body tissues and fluids. It is found in cerebrospinal fluid, is secreted in saliva, with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidneys and liver.<br /><em>Boots Infected Eyes (chloramphenicol) 1% w/w Eye Ointment UK Summary of Product Characteristics, The Boots Company Plc, updated June 2012</em>&nbsp; </div></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Caution is advised whenever nelfinavir is co-administered with agents that are inducers or inhibitors and/or substrates of CYP3A4; such combinations may require dose adjustment. Co-administration of nelfinavir with inhibitors of CYP2C19 may be expected to reduce the conversion of nelfinavir to its major active metabolite M8 (tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir) with a concomitant increase in plasma nelfinavir levels. Limited clinical trial data from patients receiving one or more of these medicinal products with nelfinavir indicated that a clinically significant effect on safety and efficacy is not expected. However, such an effect cannot be ruled out.<br /><em>Viracept&#174; (nelfinavir) Film-coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Limited, updated July 2012</em></div></span>

                    <span><p>Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the 14C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.<br /><em>Clomid&#174; (clomiphene citrate tablets USP) US Prescribing Information, Sanofi-aventis U.S. revised June 2006</em></p>
<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

                    <span><p>The effect of CHOP chemotherapy (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) for non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) on the pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving indinavir (800 mg three times daily, n=7) or nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily, n=3). Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls. When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target. Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP). The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations. However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.

Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p></span>

About 5% of a dose is eliminated in the faeces. Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Nelfinavir could potentially increase dihydrocodeine exposure (inhibition of CYP3A4) and increase the conversion to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide (induction of UGT2B7).

However, coadministration of Echinacea and lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir).

The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted. Certainly echinacea could contribute to inter-patient variability in protease inhibitor levels. <br /><em>The effect of echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) root on cytochrome P450 activity in vivo.

<p>Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained from HIV+ patients receiving nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) alone and in combination, 4 and 32 weeks of therapy. Data from 36 profiles of nelfinavir alone and 37 profiles of nelfinavir + efavirenz showed that efavirenz reduced nelfinavir AUC by 25% (from 30.5 to 22.8 &#181;h.h/ml) and reduced Cmin by 45% (from 1.1 to 0.6 &#181;g/ml); there was no significant effect on Cmax (4.3 vs 3.7 &#181;g/ml).

Nelfinavir CL/F was significantly higher with coadministration of efavirenz (19% and 9%, higher, profiles and single samples respectively); M8 CL/F was higher by 43% and 77% (profiles and single samples respectively).

<p>A pharmacokinetic study in 18 HIV+ individuals who were receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily), nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 h) and stavudine showed that nelfinavir concentrations were consistent with those achieved without efavirenz. The authors conclude that no <em>a priorii</em> dose adjustment is required when nelfinavir is coadministered with efavirenz, however in 4/18 patients nelfinavir concentrations were below the MEC (400 ng/ml) and a strategy of adjusting nelfinavir dosage based on measurements of total body systemic exposure should be further evaluated. <br /><em>Clinical pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir combined with efavirenz and stavudine during rescue treatment of heavily pretreated HIV-infected patients.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 h) resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC of nelfinavir and a 37% decrease in the AUC of the nelfinavir metabolite.

Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight.

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Empagliflozin is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A3, 1A8, 1A9 and 2B7. It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as nelfinavir may reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required. An effect on concentrations of nelfinavir is unlikely as empagliflozin does not inhibit or induce CYPs and does not inhibit UGTs.</p></span>

<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes.

<p>A case report described an interaction between nelfinavir and ergotamine. An HIV + patient was receiving nelfinavir as part of HAART therapy and self-administered antimigraine medication containing ergotamine (2 mg ergotamine tartrate and 200 mg caffeine). The patient experienced pain and cyanosis in all her toes, these symptoms subsided within 15 days. Eight months later she took the same antimigraine treatment and symptoms of cyanosis and oedema in her feet and hands developed, with severe pain. No specific treatment was given and the symptoms eventually subsided.<br /><em>Ergotism related to interaction between nelfinavir and ergotamine. Mortier E, Pouchot J &amp; Vinceneux P.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Everolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4.  Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as FPV/NFV, are expected to increase everolimus exposure. Use caution when co-administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors cannot be avoided. If patients require co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 or PgP inhibitor, dose reduction to 5 mg daily or 5 mg every other day may be considered. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment. Due to between subject variability the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal in all individuals, therefore close monitoring of side effects is recommended.</span>

<p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (800 mg three times daily) and amprenavir (800 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Nelfinavir had no significant effect on amprenavir AUC and decreased Cmax by 21%. There was 167% increase in amprenavir Cmin. The increase in Cmin with no increase in overall exposure (AUC) may improve the efficacy of amprenavir while maintaining its good safety profile. When compared with historical controls, there was a 15% increase in nelfinavir AUC, a 12% increase in Cmax and 14% increase in Cmin.

<p><strong>Amprenavir/Nelfinavir/Efavirenz</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

Coadministration had no effect on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations, but decreased midazolam AUC by 34% and Cmax by 31%. The results suggest that Gingko biloba extract is unlikely to reduce exposure of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, but unboosted regimens may be affected. <br /><em>Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on lopinavir, midazolam and fexofenadine pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin.

<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Nelfinavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As nelfinavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of nelfinavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as nelfinavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect. </span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

<p>Concentrations of both indinavir and nelfinavir were increased when the two agents were coadministered. Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) with a single dose of indinavir (800 mg), in 6 subjects, caused a 51% increase in indinavir AUC and a 10% decrease in Cmax. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) with a single dose of nelfinavir (750 mg) caused an 83% and 31% increase in nelfinavir AUC and Cmax, respectively.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily), and indinavir (1000 and 1200 mg twice daily) with nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) were investigated in HIV+ subjects. In the indinavir alone group, indinavir trough concentrations (median with range) at the start and end of the dosing interval were 369 (&lt;10-949) ng/ml and 159 (85-506) n/ml respectively; Cmax and AUC were 5508 (2864-19786) ng/ml and 16715 (5705-28084) ng/ml.h respectively. Following coadministration of indinavir 1000 mg with nelfinavir, indinavir trough concentrations (median with range) at the start and end of the dosing interval were &lt;10 (&lt;10-3740) ng/ml and 44 (&lt;10-4236) n/ml respectively; Cmax and AUC were 10740 (3379-18210) ng/ml and 38863 (10623-135665) ng/ml.h respectively. Following coadministration of indinavir 1200 mg with nelfinavir, indinavir trough concentrations (median with range) at the start and end of the dosing interval were 146(58-5215) ng/ml and 95 (12-954) n/ml respectively; Cmax and AUC were 9675 (6154-18198) ng/ml and 26901 (19139-63595) ng/ml.h respectively. Median indinavir clearance was significantly lower in the nelfinavir group (34.1 L/h, IQR 22.6-45.8) than in the indinavir alone group (47.9 L/h, IQR 42.7-70.3). Nelfinavir exposures were similar regardless of indinavir dose (Ctrough, 1779 vs 1805 ng/ml; Cmax, 5826 vs 5641 ng/ml; AUC 33106 vs 33269 ng/ml.h; median, 1000 mg vs 1200 mg). There was a higher incidence of indinavir trough concentrations below the limit of detection in the 1000 mg group (6/10, 60%) than in the 1200 mg group (0/7) or in the alone group (1/8 (12.5%), suggesting that 1200 mg indinavir appears to be the preferred dose in a twice daily regimen that includes nelfinavir. More study is needed to determine the effect on nelfinavir in a ritonavir-boosted regimen. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of indinavir and nelfinavir in treatment-na&#239;ve human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir with nelfinavir to HIV+ subjects resulted in modest inhibition of indinavir elimination. Pharmacokinetic parameters following indinavir/nelfinavir (1200/1250 mg twice daily, n=11) were comparable to those following indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily, n=16): Cmin 0.15&#177;0.11 vs 0.18&#177;0.16 mg/L; Cmax 7.73&#177;2.46 vs 8.59&#177;2.52 mg/L; AUC(0-24) 56.53&#177;20.99 vs 66.91&#177;14.98 mg/L.h (mean&#177;sd, alone vs with nelfinavir). Indinavir had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of nelfinavir. The combination was generally well tolerated and resulted in sustained virological suppression with 45% of subjects having a viral load &lt;400 copies/ml at week 72 (intent-to-treat). <br /><em>Coadministration of indinavir and nelfinavir in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected adults: safety, pharmacokinetics and antiretroviral activity.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir 1000 mg and nelfinavir 1250 mg both given twice daily was evaluated in a pharmacokinetic substudy of ACTG388. It was found that indinavir did not achieve acceptable concentrations with Cmin values ranging from 0-506 ng/ml and 5/10 subjects having undetectable Cmin concentrations (compared to 1/8 when given indinavir 800 mg three times daily. Indinavir appeared to inhibit the elimination of nelfinavir and may allow less frequent dosing of nelfinavir in some patients. However the interaction between nelfinavir and indinavir is unpredictable and requires further study. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of combined indinavir and nelfinavir.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (1200 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) was studied in nine HIV+ individuals. When compared with nelfinavir historical controls (750 mg three times daily), there was a 27% increase in the daily AUC of nelfinavir, a 36% increase in Cmax and no change in Cmin in the presence of indinavir. When compared with indinavir historical controls (800 mg, three times daily), there was a 12% increase in the daily AUC of indinavir, no change in Cmax and a 16% increase in Cmin. Nelfinavir plasma levels were not obviously affected by indinavir; indinavir peak, trough and AUC values were comparable to indinavir 800 mg given three times daily alone.

<p>
<p>A study in six healthy volunteers investigated the coadministration of indinavir (800 mg three times daily) and a single dose of nelfinavir (750 mg). There was an 83% increase in nelfinavir AUC, a 32% increase in Cmax and a 22% increase in the elimination half-life of nelfinavir. Indinavir significantly increased NLF single dose exposures. Administration of a single 800 mg dose of indinavir following nelfinavir 750 mg three times daily for 7 days resulted in a 51% increase in indinavir AUC, no change in indinavir Cmax and a 5-fold increase in Cmin. <br /><em>Investigations of nelfinavir mesylate pharmacokinetic interactions with indinavir and ritonavir.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em> </span>

Co-administration of nelfinavir with omeprazole is contra-indicated. Caution is recommended when nelfinavir is co-administered with other proton pump inhibitors. Co-administration of nelfinavir with inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., lansoprazole) may be expected to reduce the conversion of nelfinavir to its major active metabolite M8 (tert-butyl hydroxy nelfinavir) with a concomitant increase in plasma nelfinavir levels. Limited clinical trial data from patients receiving one or more of these medicinal products with nelfinavir indicated that a clinically significant effect on safety and efficacy is not expected.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

An analysis of 570 HIV-infected women in Swaziland using levonorgestrel implant and lopinavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or efavirenz based regimens suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of levonorgestrel implant. Similarly, nelfinavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

The appropriate doses for this combination with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established.<br />KALETRA ORAL SOLUTION:<br />Administration of nelfinavir 1000 mg twice daily in combination with Kaletra produces a similar nelfinavir Cmax and AUC and higher Cmin relative to nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily alone. Additionally, concentrations of the active M8 metabolite of nelfinavir were increased. On the other hand, lopinavir AUC was decreased by 27% during nelfinavir co-administration with Kaletra.

<p>Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with nelfinavir. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with nelfinavir. The recommended dose of Kaletra tablets is 500/125 mg twice daily (such as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet). The recommended dose of Kaletra oral solution is 533/133 mg twice daily taken with food. Coadministration of nelfinavir (1000 mg twice daily for 10 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 21 days) to 13 HIV- subjects resulted in decreases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 21%, 27% and 38% respectively. When compared to nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily alone, nelfinavir Cmax decreased by 7%, AUC increase by 7% and Cmin increased by 86%. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (1000 mg twice daily) was assessed in 13 HIV- subjects. Lopinavir Cmax AUC and Ctrough were significantly decreased in the presence of nelfinavir (21, 27 and 33% respectively). There was a 23% decrease in ritonavir AUC, with no change in Ctrough. Concentrations of nelfinavir were similar when compared to those obtained with 1250 mg twice daily alone (AUC 25.8 vs 24.2 &#181;g/ml.h; Ctrough 1.3 vs 1.1 &#181;g/ml; with lopinavir/ritonavir vs alone). The dose of lopinavir/ritonavir may need to increased when coadministered with nelfinavir, particularly in patients with extensive protease inhibitor experience or reduced viral susceptibility to lopinavir. <br /><em>Assessment of the multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction of lopinavir/ritonavir with nelfinavir.

                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of methadone (80 &#177; 21 mg once daily for at least one month) and nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily for 8 days) decreased methadone AUC by 47%. None of the subjects experienced withdrawal symptoms in this study; however, due to the pharmacokinetic changes, it should be expected that some patients who received this combination may experience withdrawal symptoms and require an upward adjustment of the methadone dose. <br /><em>Viracept Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, September 2011.</em></p>
<p>Concentrations of methadone were decreased when coadministered with nelfinavir.&nbsp;Coadministration of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily for 8 days) with methadone (59-101 mg once daily for longer than 1 month) was investigated in 13 subjects. Total methadone AUC, Cmax and Cmin were decreased by 47%, 46% and 53%, respectively. Similar changes in the individual R and S-enantiomers were observed.&nbsp;The dosage of methadone may need to be increased when coadministered with nelfinavir. <br /><em>Viracept Prescribing Information, Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of methadone was determined in 13 HIV-negative subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy (20-140 mg/day). Nelfinavir reduced both the AUC and Cmax of R-methadone (the active enantiomer) by 43%. The AUC of S-methadone (the inactive enantiomer) was reduced by 51% and the Cmax was reduced by 50%. However, no subject experienced withdrawal symptoms or required dose adjustment. Concentrations of nelfinavir and its active metabolite were within the normal range of historical data. The geometric mean AUC of nelfinavir in the study was 39.3 mg.h/L (range 35.0-44.1); AUCs in historical controls ranged from 25.3-38.3 mg.h/L. Nelfinavir Cmax (mean, range) was 5.26 (4.77-5.80) mg/L in the study and ranged from 3.9-5.3 mg/L in historical controls. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction of nelfinavir and methadone in intravenous drug users. Hsyu PH, Lillibridge J, Daniels E, Kerr BM. Biopharm Drug Dispos. 2006 Mar;27(2):61-8.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (1250 mg bid) with methadone (40-120 mg per day) was studied in 16 healthy volunteers. Nelfinavir pharmacokinetics did not differ significantly although exposure tended to be higher than control. Nelfinavir metabolite M8 pharmacokinetics were significantly lower than control, with M8 Cmax and AUC0-12 53% and 47% lower than control respectively. These results may be due to inhibition of nelfinavir metabolism to M8.<br /><em>Effect of methadone or LAAM on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir and M8.

<p>The effect of nelfinavir on maintenance methadone dose requirements was evaluated in clinical practice. Of the 76 subjects studied, 70 required no change in methadone dose. 3/76 voluntarily decreased their methadone in an effort to overcome addiction, 1/76 required an increase in methadone dose, but this may have been due to concomitant administration of phenytoin and phenobarbital. Only 2/76 required an increase in methadone dose where it may have been due to withdrawal symptoms. In clinical practice, nelfinavir appears to have no significant impact on the maintenance dose of methadone in the majority of patients.<br /><em>Lack of effect of nelfinavir mesylate on maintenance methadone dose requirement.

<p>Case reports of two patients where addition of nelfinavir reduced the concentration of methadone, in one patient from 163 ng/ml to 80 ng/ml and in the other from 346 ng/ml to 144 ng/ml. Indinavir or saquinavir appear to be safer than ritonavir or nelfinavir for patients on methadone maintenance.<br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of methadone in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

As nelfinavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier). Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Neostigmine is thought to undergo a degree of hepatic metabolism, although the mechanisms are unknown. However, as metabolism also occurs via hydrolysis by cholinesterase and up to 50% of a dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is little potential for clinically significant interaction with antiretrovirals via liver enzyme modification.</span>

                    <span><p>Neostigmine undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterase and is also metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) and nevirapine (200 mg bd) were evaluated in 13 HIV+, antiretroviral-experienced patients. The mean trough concentrations of nelfinavir remained above the minimum target concentration and there was no significant difference in AUC when administered with nevirapine. Based on these results, an increase in standard nelfinavir dose was not recommended to maintain antiviral efficacy. <br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of combination therapy with nelfinavir plus nevirapine in HIV positive patients.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals.

<p><strong>Nelfinavir + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>The influence of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics on nelfinavir given with low dose ritonavir in once daily regimens was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed after the addition of nevirapine (400 mg od) to three nelfinavir/ritonavir regimens (2000/200, 2000/400 and 2500/200 mg). Since ritonavir strongly increases the ratio of active metabolite (M8) to parent nelfinavir, nelfinavir and M8 concentrations were combined. AUC and Cmin values for combined nelfinavir and M8 after addition of nevirapine were at least equivalent to the same parameters without nevirapine. An increase in combined nelfinavir+M8 concentrations was seen in the arm containing 400 mg ritonavir and this was caused by a significant increase in nelfinavir, but not M8 levels. In both arms containing 200 mg ritonavir, nevirapine cause a significant reduction in ritonavir exposure along with decrease formation of M8. Nevirapine AUC0-24h values were 146-171 mg/L.h and appeared to be higher than reported in sparse literature data. <br /><em>Influence of once daily nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of once daily nelfinavir/ritonavir combinations in healthy volunteers.

<p>A 51-year-old man with HIV infection who was receiving extended-release nifedipine (60 mg/day) developed symptomatic orthostasis and heart block after starting antiretroviral therapy that included nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily). Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms. Drug therapy at that time consisted of nifedipine (60 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), losartan (50 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and abacavir (300 mg twice daily). Discontinuation of atenolol, and nifedipine dosage reduction to 30 mg/day were effective in managing his orthostatic changes.<br /><em>Symptomatic Orthostasis With Extended-Release Nifedipine and Protease Inhibitors.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                    <span><div>Omeprazole should not be co-administered with nelfinavir. The absorption of nelfinavir may be reduced in situations where the gastric pH is increased irrespective of cause. Co-administration of nelfinavir with omeprazole may lead to a loss of virologic response and therefore concomitant use is contra-indicated. Coadministration of omeprazole (20 mg twice daily for 4 days) administered 30 minutes before nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily for 4 days) decreased nelfinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 36%, 37% and 39%, respectively. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of the M8 metabolite of nelfinavir decreased by 92%, 89% and 75%, respectively. Omeprazole concentrations were not measured. </div>

<div><em>Viracept Prescribing Information, Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc, April 2012.</em></div>
<p>A study in 20 healthy volunteers looked at the effect of omeprazole on nelfinavir. Subjects received nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) alone followed by administration with omeprazole (40 mg once daily) each for 4 days separated by 1 week washout. Nelfinavir AUC was reduced by 36% and Cmin by 39% in the presence of omeprazole. This is a potentially clinically reduction in nelfinavir concentrations and therefore the recommendation is NOT to co-administer omeprazole with nelfinavir.<br /><em>Omeprazole significantly decreases nelfinavir systemic exposure in healthy subjects.

This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but could increase oxycodone concentrations. Oxycodone is metabolised principally to noroxycodone via CYP3A and oxymorphone via CYP2D6. Oxymorphone has some analgesic activity but is present in the plasma in low concentrations and is not considered to contribute to oxycodone's pharmacological effect. Coadministration a single dose of oxycodone (10 mg) and ritonavir (300 mg twice daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) increased the AUC of oxycodone by 3.0- and 2.6-fold, respectively. Nelfinavir may also increase oxycodone exposure through inhibition of CYP3A4 and a dose reduction of oxycodone may be required to avoid opioid-related adverse effects.</span>

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>The interaction of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) and phenytoin (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. Nelfinavir was found to reduce phenytoin exposure by ~20&#8211;40%. Phenytoin concentrations should be monitored when nelfinavir is added to chronic phenytoin treatment, as an increase in phenytoin doses may be required.<br /><em>Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interaction between phenytoin and nelfinavir in healthy volunteers at steady-state.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect.

<p>The effect of nelfinavir on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin was investigated in 14 healthy HIV- subjects. Pravastatin pharmacokinetics were determined after three days of dosing (40 mg once daily); nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) was then added to the regimen and further pharmacokinetic sampling performed on day 16. Coadministration of nelfinavir was found to reduce substantially pravastatin exposure. Median AUC values decreased by ~47% (86.5 vs 46.8 ng.h/ml) and Cmax decreased by ~40% (27.9 vs 12.4 ng.h/ml). Although the study was not powered nor designed to evaluate the effect on LDL cholesterol, a trend toward less reduction in LDL cholesterol during coadministration was observed. Given the decrease in plasma exposure of pravastatin and the suggestion of reduced efficacy, higher doses of pravastatin may be required to achieve maximal lipid lowering activity. However, further studies are required to explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of higher doses in HIV+ subjects. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between nelfinavir and pravastatin in HIV-seronegative volunteers: ACTG Study A5108.

Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls. When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target. Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP).

Careful monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.

                    <span><p>The effect of CHOP chemotherapy (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) for non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) on the pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving indinavir (800 mg three times daily, n=7) or nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily, n=3). Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls.  When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target.  Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP).  The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations.  However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.

Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Since proguanil is a prodrug, there is concern that inhibition of CYP3A4 by nelfinavir will reduce the pharmacological effect. However, synergy with atovaquone is related to proguanil, not cycloguanil. When the drugs are coadministered, CYP inhibition could potentially enhance this synergistic effect which may offset decreased cycloguanil formation.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Propofol is glucuronidated via UGTs 1A9 and 1A8, and is oxidized mainly via CYP2B6. In vivo data indicate that nelfinavir induces CYP2B6. Nelfinavir could potentially decrease propofol concentrations. The extent of this interaction is difficult to predict as propofol is a high hepatic extraction drug and therefore its rate of hepatic elimination is in theory more dependent on liver blood flow.

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

They are stored mainly in the liver where there is oxidation to 4-pyridoxic acid and other inactive metabolites which are excreted in the urine. As the dose increases, proportionally greater amounts are excreted unchanged in the urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

However, the US Prescribing Information recommends that quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if coadministered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.

Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. It is released from the liver bound to a specific &#945;1-globulin (retinol-binding protein) in the blood. The retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid; these and other metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

Comparable changes in rifabutin concentrations were observed with nelfinavir 1250 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. It is recommended that the dose of rifabutin be reduced to one-half the usual dose when administered with nelfinavir; 1250 mg twice daily is the preferred dose of nelfinavir when these two agents are coadministered. <br /><em>Viracept Prescribing Information, Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>A study of HIV+ individuals taking rifabutin and HAART concurrently were investigated for the effects of rifabutin on PIs (namely indinavir and nelfinavir). It was concluded that rifabutin could be given with PIs with successful clinical response in HIV and TB disease without an increase in side effects. A nelfinavir dose of 1250 mg twice daily may give adequate levels. Further studies are needed.<br /><em>Use of rifabutin with protease inhibitors for Human Immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with TB. Narita M, Stambaugh JJ, Hollender ES, et al.

<p>A case report states that a 7-month old male started on TB medication including rifampicin and was diagnosed with HIV and began HAART containing nelfinavir (39 mg/kg tds). The AUC and Cmin for nelfinavir and metabolite M8 were well below adult population levels for this dose. Ritonavir (380 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bd) was added to boost nelfinavir levels (dose now 27 mg/kg bd). These levels were still too low but the AUC and Cmin of M8 highly exceeded adult values. It was concluded that nelfinavir pharmacokinetics with rifampicin was favourably altered by the addition of ritonavir due to high levels of M8 but more research is needed.<br /><em>Favourable nelfinavir pharmacokinetics during rifampicin use by co-administration of ritonavir.

An appropriate dose of nelfinavir&nbsp;for this combination, with respect to safety and efficacy, has not been established. <br /><em>Viracept Prescribing Information, Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased nelfinavir AUC by 20-39%. Coadministration of a single dose of nelfinavir (750 mg) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) increased nelfinavir AUC 152%, but had no effect on ritonavir AUC or Cmin. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of nelfinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Minimal benefit of ritonavir-mediated pharmacokinetic enhancement is achieved with doses higher than 100 mg twice daily. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (500 mg or 750 mg twice daily) was studied in 10 HIV patients. Ritonavir increased the AUC of NLF 500 mg (28 &#181;g/ml.h) and 750 mg bd (26 &#181;g/ml.h) when compared with historical 750 mg controls (20 &#181;g/ml.h). AUC of M8 also increased: 19 &#181;g/ml.h (500 mg), 25 &#181;g/ml.h (750 mg), 6 &#181;g/ml.h (750 mg controls). Concurrent ritonavir increased nelfinavir AUC and significantly increased concentrations of M8. Optimal dose of this BD combination must be determined in long-term treatment trials.<br /><em>Steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir, nelfinavir and the nelfinavir active metabolite M8. Flexner C, Hsu A, Kerr B. 12th World AIDS Conference, 1998, abstract 42265.</em></p>
<p>This study describes the effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (1250 mg bd) of adding 100 or 200 mg RTV. This was a randomised, open-label, one-sequence crossover study in healthy volunteers of NFV dosed alone for 17 days and then with RTV for another 14 days. Irrespective of dose, RTV increased the AUC of NFV by 20% and 39% after both morning and evening administration respectively. The AUC of the metabolite M8 was increased by 74% and 86% after the morning and evening doses (this is either induction of formation of M8 by CYP2C19 or inhibition of the further metabolism of M8 which is catalysed by CYP3A4). During ritonavir combination therapy, a clear but minor drug effect on nelfinavir pharmacokinetics was demonstrated but no dose effect was shown. <br /><em>Low dose ritonavir moderately enhances nelfinavir exposure.

Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite.

<p>A 70-year-old white man was admitted to San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center with a 1-week history of progressive muscle weakness, myalgias, and diarrhea. He was HIV-1 infected, with an absolute CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 216 cells/ml and a serum HIV-1 RNA load of &lt;50 copies/ml before admission to the hospital. His antiretroviral therapy regimen consisted of zidovudine (300 mg/day), lamivudine (150 mg twice daily), and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) at the time of admission. This regimenhad not been changed in &gt;2 years. The patient also had a history of hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease, with coronary artery bypass grafting having been performed in 1986. Six months before admission, the patient's lipid-lowering medication was changed from simvastatin (10 mg/day) to pravastatin (40 mg/day). Because elevated LDL cholesterol levels were noted while the patient was taking pravastatin (40 mg/day), treatment with simvastatin (80 mg/day) was reintroduced 1 month prior to admission. The patient was also taking aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (25 mg/day). He took no herbal or over-the-counter medications, and he did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Three weeks after initiation of treatment with the higher simvastatin dosage, the patient noted the development of new progressive muscle weakness, which caused him to fall several times, and an increase in the severity of diarrhea, which had been mild at baseline. He denied having recently exercised strenuously or having sustained trauma, and he had no prior history of HIV myopathy. Laboratory evaluation revealed findings that were consistent with rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase, 78,000 U/L [the troponin-I level was within normal limits]; alanine aminotransferase, 2301 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 659 U/L; and myoglobinuria) and acute renal failure (blood urea nitrogen, 29 mM; and serum creatinine, 5.6 mg/dL). Serum levels of amylase and lipase were within the range considered to be normal by the laboratory. Results of blood cultures, toxicology screening tests, and serological testing for acute hepatitis were negative. The patient developed worsening renal failure and oliguria that required hemodialysis. When he subsequently developed abdominal pain, laboratory findings demonstrated metabolic acidosis (pH, 7.28; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 30 mm Hg; and serum bicarbonate, 18 mM) and an elevated troponin-I level of 6.62 ng/mL (normal level, &lt;0.03 ng/mL). The patient died suddenly, and no resuscitation was attempted, in accordance with his previously expressed wishes. Autopsy demonstrated a large acute myocardial infarction of the posterior wall and colonic ischemia. <br /><em>Simvastatin-nelfinavir interaction implicated in rhabdomyolysis and death.

Nelfinavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.

Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. The effects of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting of renal impairment has not been assessed in a clinical study.<br /><em>Januvia Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp&nbsp; &amp; Dohme Ltd, August 2012.</em></div></span>

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated 01/08/2007, accessed 03/04/2012</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. At 6 h blood levels had fallen to less than 1% of peak values. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. If shorter courses are ineffective prolonged and continued courses may be given provided that renal function is assessed and the dosage is adjusted when indicated.<br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate). Rees PH, Keating MI, Kager PA, Hockmeyer WT. Lancet. 1980 Aug 2;2(8188):226-9</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The maximum concentration of Sb achieved was 8.77 (0.39) mg/L and the peak time was 1.34 (0.09) hr. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. The frequency distribution pattern of the area-under-the-curve (AUC) appears to be bimodal and separates patients into those with low exposure to Sb (AUC = 11.7-29.04 mg.hr/L) (i.e., rapid eliminators) and those with high exposure to Sb (AUC = 31.5-49.1 mg.hr/L) (i.e., slow eliminators). This may explain the variability observed in the response to treatment of leishmaniasis with sodium stibogluconate.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism. Winter HR, Unadkat JD. Drug Metab Dispos. 2005 Jul;33(7):969-76.</em></p>
<p>An in vitro study investigated the interaction between tolbutamide and sulfonamides using metabolic inhibition studies. The inhibition constant (K(i)) was derived from the inhibitory effects of eight sulfonamides (sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethizole, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfapyridine, sulfadimethoxine, and sulfamonomethoxine) on tolbutamide metabolism. The inhibitory effect of sulfaphenazole was greatest among the eight sulfonamides examined. The contribution of each P450 enzyme to tolbutamide metabolism was investigated using recombinant P450 enzymes. Although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 metabolized tolbutamide, the main enzyme involved was CYP2C9. The K(i) values of several sulfonamides were comparable between human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP2C9. Using the K(i) values obtained from in vitro inhibition studies, the degree of increase in tolbutamide area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was predicted. About 4.8- and 1.6-fold increases in tolbutamide AUC were predicted by coadministration of sulfaphenazole and sulfamethizole, respectively. The increase in tolbutamide AUC by coadministration of sulfadiazine, sulfisoxazole, and sulfamethizole was predicted to be 1.5- to 2. 6-fold, although the corresponding in vivo effects have not been reported. Sulfonamides should be carefully coadministered with CYP2C9 substrates such as tolbutamide, especially coadministration of sulfaphenazole.<br /><em>Prediction of in vivo drug-drug interactions between tolbutamide and various sulfonamides in humans based on in vitro experiments.

<p>The influence on the metabolism of phenytoin of some sulfonamides given in common clinical doses was studied. In single dose experiments sulfaphenazole increased phenytoin half-life (T/2) by 237% and decreased phenytoin metabolic clearance rate (MCR) by 67%. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethiazole, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim and trimethoprim increased phenytoin T/2 by 80, 66, 39 and 51% respectively, and decreased phenytoin MCR by 45, 36, 27 and 30% respectively. Sulfamethoxazole gave a small but significant increase in phenytoin T/2 but not a corresponding fall in phenytoin MCR. No changes were found in phenytoin T/2 and MCR after treatment with sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethoxydiazine. Steady state experiments confirmed the findings of the single dose experiments. It is suggested that sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim and trimethoprim inhibit hepatic metabolism of phenytoin.<br /><em>The effect of different sulfonamides on phenytoin metabolism in man.

<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body.

Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21).

<p>The interaction between tacrolimus and antiretroviral therapy (ART) was studied in 2 HIV/HCV coinfected patients who had received liver transplants. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were determined at steady state during the post operative period before and after the reintroduction of ART once tacrolimus concentrations and liver function had stabilised. Both patients taking nelfinavir required a 75-93% decrease in tacrolimus dose and showed decreases in tacrolimus oral clearance, one from 2137 to 43 ml/min, the other from 257 to 29 ml/min. Concentrations of nelfinavir were within the ranges published for patients with normal liver function tests. <br /><em>Effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in hepatitis C virus and HIV co-infected liver transplant recipients in the ANRS HC-08 study.

<p>The management of drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and tacrolimus in 10 HIV patients was reported. Antiretroviral agents were stopped on the day of liver transplantation and reintroduced 10 days later. All patients received tacrolimus and prednisolone as immunosuppressive agents and fluconazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ganciclovir as primary prophylaxis. Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters were measured 10 days following liver transplantation and 10 days following antiretroviral re-initiation. Tacrolimus target blood concentrations were 8-20 ng/ml from baseline to week 6 and 5-15 ng/ml after week 6; tacrolimus doses were individually adjusted according to the Ctrough measured. Among the patients studied, two were on nelfinavir, three on lopinavir/ritonavir, two on efavirenz and one on three NRTIs. While the NRTIs and efavirenz led to a slight change in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir caused a large inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism, resulting in an increase in its half-life and a decrease in its clearance. Therefore, tacrolimus plasma concentrations should be monitored and drug dose adjustments performed.

<p>There are reports of two cases where blood levels of tacrolimus were elevated when nelfinavir was reintroduced post operatively. In one case, the dose of tacrolimus had to be decreased to 0.5 mg once a week (~1/70 of normal dose) and in the other, coadministration of nelfinavir necessitated a 95% reduction in tacrolimus dose (from 4 mg twice daily to 0.5 mg every 3&#8211;5 days). Thus, careful monitoring of drug levels are required and dose reduction should be considered.<br /><em>Interaction between nelfinavir and tacrolimus after orthoptic liver transplantation in a patient coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may decrease nelfinavir exposure due to induction of CYP3A4 by tamoxifen and could potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by nelfinavir. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.</span>

<p><em></em></p>
<p>The effect of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) on the pharmaocokinetics of nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) was investigated in 13 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of tenofovir had no effect on the exposure of nelfinavir; geometric mean ratios for AUC, Cmax and Cmin were was 0.97, 0.99 and 1.02, respectively. There was a slight decrease in AUC of the M8 metabolite (GMR 0.87), but this was not significant. No dose adjustment of nelfinavir is required when coadministered with tenofovir. <br />

<p>The interaction between nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) was studied in 29 HIV-negative volunteers. Overall, the 90% CI for the geometric mean ratios for AUC, Cmax and Ctrough after coadministration compared with the drugs administered alone were within the bioequivalence bounds of 70-143%. Means steady state M8:NFV ratio for AUC were similar when nelfinavir was administered alone (0.44) or with tenofovir (0.45). <br />

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. The isoenzymes involved in thiopental metabolism have not been identified. Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for nelfinavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range. </span>

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased nelfinavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As nelfinavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

Indinavir AUC when administered without CHOP was lower than expected (14.9 &#177; 9.5mg.h/L); however it increased by 38% (to 20.5 &#177; 9.0 vs mg.h/L, P=0.03) when given with CHOP and was then comparable to historical controls. When given without CHOP, indinavir trough concentrations at 0 and 8 h were below target (0.1 mg/L) in 3/7 patients; when given with CHOP no 0 h concentrations were below target and 2/7 8h concentrations were below target. Nelfinavir AUC and Cmax values were higher when given with CHOP, though this was not statistically significant (AUC 12.2 &#177; 3.6 vs 15.6 &#177; 7.0, Cmax 2.3 &#177; 0.3 vs 2.8 &#177; 1.5, alone vs with CHOP). The study suggests that patients with NHL may have lower PI concentrations and that CHOP increases PI concentrations. However, no dose modification of indinavir appears to be required, though TDM of PIs is recommended for HIV-infected patients receiving chemotherapy for NHL. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and protease inhibitors in HIV-1-infected patients.
