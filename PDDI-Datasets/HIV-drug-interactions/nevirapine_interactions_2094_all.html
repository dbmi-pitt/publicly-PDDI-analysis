                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. When antiepileptics phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital were coadministered with albendazole, significantly reduced levels of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide were observed, appaprently due to induction of CYP3A4. As nevirapine may also induce CYP3A4, an interaction with albendazole cannot be ruled out.</span>

                    <span><p>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

<p>Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital appear to induce the oxidative metabolism of albendazole via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A by roughly the same extent, resulting in significantly reduced concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide. This interaction is likely to be clinically significant when albendazole is used to treat systemic worm infections, and increased doses of albendazole would be needed. The interaction is probably not clinically significant when albendazole is used for intestinal worm infections. <br /><em>Lanchote VL, et al.

Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Other potent inducers of CYP3A4 (such as efavirenz and nevirapine) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of aripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em></span>

With doses of 300/100 mg, atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 42%, 28% and 72%, respectively. Increasing the dose to 400/100 mg (and compared to 300/100 mg alone) decreased atazanavir AUC by 19%, increased Cmax by 2% and decreased Cmin by 59%. Nevirapine AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 25%, 17% and 32%, respectively with the 300/100 mg regimen and by 26%, 21% and 35% with the 400/100 mg regimen. <br /></div><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p>
<p>The influence of nevirapine on atazanavir trough concentrations (Ctrough) was studied in a group of HIV-infected patients (n=11) receiving 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir once daily for 2 weeks or longer. Nevirapine was added at a dose of 200 mg once daily from Days 0 to 14 and 200 mg twice daily from Days 14 to 28. Atazanavir and nevirapine plasma Ctroughs were determined at Days 0 and 28. The geometric mean atazanavir Ctrough decreased from 0.631 mg/L (range, 0.235-1.87 mg/L) at Day 0 to 0.316 mg/L (range, 0.142-1.109 mg/L) at Day 28 to give a geometric mean ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.80; P = 0.026); nonetheless, the atazanavir Ctrough remained higher than the minimum effective concentration in 80% of the participants and higher than the median concentration in historical control subjects receiving 400 mg atazanavir once daily without ritonavir (GMR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.65-6.22; P = 0.001). The authors conclude that monitoring atazanavir Ctrough is recommended in patients treated with this drug combination, and increasing the atazanavir dose might be necessary. <br /><em>Effect of nevirapine on the steady-state trough concentrations of atazanavir in HIV-infected patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir. Molto J, Deig E, Valle M, et al. Ther Drug Monit, 2010, 32(1): 93-96.</em></p>
<p>Trough concentrations were obtained from 16 patients receiving nevirapine once daily (400 mg) with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg, n=7; 400/100 mg n=9). Median atazanavir trough concentrations were 340 ng/ml and 520 ng/ml for the 300 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively; values obtained from historical controls receiving 300/100 mg were 610 ng/ml. Nevirapine trough concentrations were 3900 ng/ml and 4000 ng/ml for the two groups and were comparable to literature values for patients treated with nevirapine alone (3700 ng/ml). Given the decrease in atazanavir trough concentrations, relative to historical controls, therapeutic drug monitoring of atazanavir may be appropriate for patients (especially if treatment experienced) receiving this combination. <br /><em>Plasma concentrations of atazanavir in HIV patients treated with regimens including nevirapine. Kurowski M, et al. 8th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, November 2006, abstract 276.</em></p>
<p>Steady state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazananavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. <br /><em>Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

Atovaquone is eliminated mainly unchanged in the faeces, but coadministration of efavirenz and atovaquone/proguanil resulted in decreases of 70% and 50% for atovaquone and proguanil AUC, respectively. The mechanism for this was suggested to be induction of glucuronidation by efavirenz. The clinical relevance is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Due the potential for some NNRTIs to induce glucuronidation and in the absence of data, caution is recommended when coadministering nevirapine and atovaquone. Consider taking atovaquone with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

<div>In vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role.Nevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring within 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. Compounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised medicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine.<br /><em>Viramune&#174; (nevirapine) 200mg Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated February 2012</em></div></span>

Opiate withdrawal symptoms, cognitive effects, and adverse events were determined prior to and following nevirapine administration. Modest decreases were observed for AUC for buprenorphine (9%) and norbuprenorphine (14%). Clinically significant consequences of the interaction were not observed.

When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4, e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort, an adjustment of the dosage of buspirone may be necessary to maintain buspirone&#8217;s anxiolytic effect.<br /><em>Buspirone Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, August 2012.</em></p>
<p>Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone or certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Consequently, when administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended. When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4 the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect.<br /><em>Buspar Prescribing Information, Bristol Myers Squibb, November 2010.</em></p></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that chloramphenicol can inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration of chloramphenicol may potentially increase levels of nevirapine via this mechanism, increasing the risk of adverse events. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.  Ocular use: Although chloramphenicol is systemically absorbed when used topically in the eye, the concentrations used are unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction.</span>

                    <span><p>The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Evidence suggests that chloramphenicol is absorbed systemically via topical ocular administration. Any chloramphenicol that is absorbed will be widely distributed in the body tissues and fluids. It is found in cerebrospinal fluid, is secreted in saliva, with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidneys and liver.<br /><em>Boots Infected Eyes (chloramphenicol) 1% w/w Eye Ointment UK Summary of Product Characteristics, The Boots Company Plc, updated June 2012</em> </div>

<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily), in 15 HIV+ patients, resulted in a 31% ,23% and 57% decrease in clarithromycin AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. 14-OH-clarithromycin AUC and Cmax were increased by 42% and 47%, respectively, and Cmin was unaltered.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was studied in 18 HIV+ individuals. There was a 30% reduction in clarithromycin AUC, a 21% decrease in Cmax and a 46% decrease in Cmin. AUC of 14-OH clarithromycin increased by 58% and Cmax increased by ~60%. Results suggest that NVP increased the metabolic clearance of clarithromycin to its active metabolite resulting in lower steady-state concentrations of parent drug and higher concentrations of metabolite. Coadministration of clarithromycin resulted in a 26% increase in nevirapine AUC, a 24% increase in Cmax and a 28% increase in Cmin. <em><br />Effect of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin in HIV-positive patients.

                    <span><p>Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the 14C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.<br /><em>Clomid&#174; (clomiphene citrate tablets USP) US Prescribing Information, Sanofi-aventis U.S. revised June 2006</em></p>
<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. These studies suggest that inducers of CYP3A4 (such as nevirapine) may increase metabolism of vitamin D and therefore reduce its effect.

<p>An open label, randomised cross over study investigated the pharmacokinetic interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and nevirapine. Nineteen HIV+ patients received nevirapine (200 mg twice daily with 2 or more NRTIs) in combination with darunavir oral solution (300 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily) or darunavir tablet (400 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily) in two 14-day sessions. At these lower than licensed doses, darunavir/ritonavir increased mean nevirapine AUC by 27% (least square means ratio 1.27; 95% confidence interval 1.02, 1.58). Mean darunavir and ritonavir exposures were similar to historical data. No dose adjustments are considered to be required based on a) dose proportionality of darunavir PK and b) coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is generally well tolerated. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and darunavir with low-dose ritonavir in HIV-1-infected patients.

<p>Data from TDM and a population PK approach were used to examine the influence of coadministered drugs on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in a cohort of 51 patients. In the final one compartment model there was relationship between nevirapine clearance and the presence of darunavir in the regimen. There was a significant decrease in clearance (CL/f, 3.84 &#177; 0.92 vs 2.76 &#177; 1.00 L/h) and an increase in the mean nevirapine trough plasma concentrations (3.68 &#177; 1.69 vs 5.35 &#177; 3.20 mg/L) in combination with darunavir. The limitations of the study are that it is TDM data and small numbers. The advantage is that these are results obtained with the recommended twice daily dose of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) rather than the lower doses (300/100 or 400/100 mg) used in the early interaction studies. <br /><em>Influence of darunavir coadministration on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients: a population approach.

                    <span><div>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011<br /><br /></em></div>
<div>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em></div>
<p>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Desogestrel is a prodrug that requires activation to etonogestrel. Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration is predicted to decrease etonogestrel due to induction of CYP3A4. A reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

<p>Nevirapine may be administered with or without food, antacid or didanosine. Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with didanosine (100-150 mg twice daily) in 18 HIV+ patients caused no alteration in didanosine AUC or Cmax, Cmin was below the limits of detection for the assay. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. In a separate study in HIV-1 infected patients (n=6), nevirapine steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered by didanosine, which is formulated with an alkaline buffering agent. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Addition of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) to a regimen of didanosine (125 or 200 mg twice daily) and zidovudine in 80 HIV+ individuals showed that nevirapine did not interfere with the bioavailability of ddI.

After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

<p>In a study efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and nevirapine (400 mg once daily) were coadministered. The result was a significant decrease in efavirenz AUC, Cmin and Cmax by 22%, 36% and 17%, respectively. More studies are needed to find the correct dose of efavirenz to use with nevirapine but a dose increase of efavirenz to 800 mg once daily may be warranted.

                    <span><p>Due to the metabolic pathway no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and nevirapine. Enfuvirtide and nevirapine can be co-administered without dose adjustments. <br /><em>Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Everolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4 and coadministration could potentially decrease everolimus concentrations. Avoid the use of concomitant potent CYP3A4 inducers. If patients require co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer, a dose increase from 10 mg daily up to 20 mg daily should be considered using 5 mg increments applied on Day 4 and 8 following start of the inducer. This dose of everolimus is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment. If treatment with the inducer is discontinued, the everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the co-administration.</span>

Nevirapine exposure increased by 100% compared with historical data where nevirapine was administered alone. Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be exercised if the medicinal products are given concomitantly and patients should be monitored closely. <br /><em>Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with fluconazole (200 mg once daily) in 19 HIV+ patients caused no alteration in fluconazole AUC, Cmax or Cmin. Administration of fluconazole resulted in an approximate 100% increase in nevirapine exposure, based on a comparison to historic data. Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Pharmacokinetics of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and fluconazole ( 200 mg three times weekly) were determined in 27 HIV+ patients and compared to data from 22 HIV+ subjects receiving nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and placebo. Fluconazole increased nevirapine AUC by 33% (from 34297 ng.h/ml to 45685 ng.h/ml); increases were also observed in median Cmax (5028 vs 6354 ng/ml) and Cmin (3709 vs 5116 ng/ml). Despite the increase in nevirapine exposure, there was no evidence of increased hepatotoxicity. <br /><em>Coadministration of fluconazole increases nevirapine concentrations in HIV-infected Ugandans. Wakeham K, et al. 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Montreal, February 2009, abstract 700.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with fluconazole (200 mg once daily) caused an approximate doubling of nevirapine Cmin, Cmax and AUC compared to historical controls. Furthermore, 95% of drug related adverse events occurred during the period of coadministration of fluconazole and nevirapine. Nevirapine did not significantly influence the plasma levels of fluconazole. The authors suggest that in light of the increased incidence of toxicity the combination of nevirapine and fluconazole should be used with caution. <br /><em>Effect of fluconazole on nevirapine pharmacokinetics.

<p>The interaction between fosamprenavir/ritonavir and nevirapine was investigated in 17 HIV+ patients and data compared to historical controls. Coadministration of fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) with nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmin (39%), Cmax (25%) and AUC (37%); increases were observed in nevirapine Cmin (34%), Cmax (25%) and AUC (29%). Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) and nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmin (19%), Cmax (3%) and AUC (11%); increases were observed in nevirapine Cmin (21%), Cmax (13%) and AUC (14%). Due to significantly lower amprenavir exposure, unboosted fosamprenavir is not recommended with nevirapine. When nevirapine is coadministered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir, no change in dose of any drug is required and this should be considered instead of an unboosted regimen. <br /><em>Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir and nevirapine in HIV-infected patients (APV10014).

<p>Five HIV+ patients receiving nevirapine (200 mg bd), amprenavir (600 mg bd) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg bd) were studied. Amprenavir concentrations were in the expected ranges (Cmin 560-3090 ng/ml; Cmax 1760-8040 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 13230-75170 ng/ml.h). However, lopinavir concentrations were quite variable (Cmin 620-5980 ng/ml; Cmax 2710-12600 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 998-175140 ng/ml.h) and 40-60% lower than reported by the manufacturer. The combination of amprenavir, lopinavir and nevirapine may result in unpredictable lopinavir concentrations and pharmacological monitoring is advisable in patients treated with such combinations. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and lopinavir in combination with nevirapine in highly pretreated HIV-infected patients.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin.

<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin but nevirapine is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1).

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of nevirapine via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Pretreatment with the CYP3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both ifosfamide metabolites. induction of CYP2B enzymes by high-dose phenobarbital pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of ifosfamide undergoing 4-hydroxylation  from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. As nevirapine is an enzyme inducer, there is potential for ifosfamide levels to be reduced if coadministered.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), latest modification: 20-Aug-2010<br />Wagner T. Clin Pharmacokinet 1994; 26: 439&#8211;56; Boddy AV, Yule SM.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>In an animal study in which rats were treated with ifosfamide alone or in conjunction with various P450 inducers and inhibitors, induction of liver P450 2B enzymes by 4-day high-dose phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment significantly decreased the fraction of IF undergoing 4-hydroxylation&nbsp; from 37% to 22% of total metabolism. Pretreatment with the P450 3A inducer dexamethasone proportionally decreased the AUC for both IF metabolites, without any net impact on the fraction of IF undergoing metabolic activation. These findings demonstrate specific roles for P450 2B and 3A enzymes in catalysing these pathways of IF metabolism in vivo. These studies also highlight several clinically relevant drug interactions that may occur during concomitant administration of IF with drugs and other compounds that modulate hepatic P450 enzyme levels.<br /><em>Modulation of P450-dependent ifosfamide pharmacokinetics: a better understanding of drug activation in vivo.

<div>Oral rifampicin given twice daily for 6 days, starting 3 days before intravenous ifosfamide (as a 24-hour infusion), increased the clearance of ifosfamide by over 100%; however, exposure to metabolites of ifosfamide was relatively unchanged.

Pre-treatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600 mg followed by a single 400 mg dose of imatinib resulted in decrease in Cmax and AUC by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with imatinib while taking enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as carbazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin. The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window.

The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED&#8217;s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. Concomitant administration of imatinib and St. John&#8217;s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib.

Cmin and Cmax following indinavir 800 mg were 266 &#177; 91 and 8402 &#177; 444 ng/ml, respectively. Following coadministration of indinavir 1000 mg every 8 h with nevirapine, indinavir Cmin and Cmax were 105 &#177; 21 and 8354 &#177; 535 ng/ml, respectively (mean &#177; sem). <br /><em>Launay O, Peytavin G, Landre P, et al. 40th ICAAC, Toronto, September 2000, presentation 1632.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) was studied in 19 HIV+ individuals. There was a ~27% reduction in indinavir AUC, a ~11% reduction in Cmax and a 47.5% reduction in Cmin. The data in this study do not support changing the indinavir dose on the basis of pharmacokinetic changes alone. Despite significant pharmacokinetic interactions, the combination of these drugs at the standard doses is associated with sustained and potent antiviral activity. <br /><em>Antiviral effect and pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and indinavir in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and indinavir (800 mg every 8 h) was studied in 17 HIV+ individuals. Indinavir Cmax decreased by 26% following the afternoon dose and by 51% following the morning dose when compared to historical controls. There was a 43% decrease in indinavir Cmin. Nevirapine Cmax and Cmin did not differ significantly from historical controls. The clinical implication of this pharmacokinetic interaction and the role of dosage adjustment for indinavir merit further study. <br /><em>A pilot study of nevirapine, indinavir and lamivudine among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease who have had failure of combination therapy.

<p><strong>Indinavir + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>A retrospective analysis was performed on all samples in the Dutch TDM programme to identify those HIV+ subjects receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) alone (n=139) or in combination with nevirapine (200 mg twice daily; n=21). Indinavir geometric mean Cmin was 0.49 mg/L (95% CI, 0.35-0.6 8mg/L) in the nevirapine group versus 1.14 mg/L (95% CI, 1.00-1.29 mg/L) in the control group (57% difference, P&lt;0.001). No subject in either group had an indinavir Cmin below the proposed minimum effective level (0.10 mg/L). Ritonavir Cmin values were also lower in the nevirapine group than in the control group; 0.22 (0.15-0.31) mg/L vs 0.52 (0.46-0.60) mg/ml; nevirapine vs alone, 58% difference, P&lt;0.001. The effect of nevirapine may be either directly on indinavir or indirectly through the effect on ritonavir. In treatment-na&#239;ve patients there appears to be no need to modify the dose. In treatment-experienced patients, or when viral susceptibility to indinavir may be decreased, dose increase of indinavir to 1000 mg or ritonavir to 200 mg could be considered. <br /><em>The effect of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg bid.

<p>The effect of nevirapine (200 mg bd) on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir when given in combination with low dose ritonavir (800/100 mg bd) were studied in two groups of patients and revealed a 57% decrease in indinavir trough concentrations in the presence of nevirapine. Trough concentrations were 490 ng/ml (250-680 ng/ml) in the nevirapine group (n = 21) and 1140 ng/ml (1000-1290 ng/ml) in the control group (n=139).

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em></span>

<p>The effect of efavirenz- or nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) coadministration on levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics was studied in three groups of HIV-infected Ugandan women: ART-naive (n=17), efavirenz-based ART (n=20), and nevirapine-based ART (n=20). Levonorgestrel implants were inserted at baseline in all women. In one year of combined use, levonorgestrel exposure was markedly reduced in participants who received efavirenz-based ART, accompanied by contraceptive failures. In contrast, nevirapine-based ART did not adversely affect levonorgestrel exposure or efficacy. At week 24, levonorgestrel concentration were 47% lower in the efavirenz group, and 35% higher in the nevirapine group when compared to the ART-naive group (geometric mean levonorgestrel concentrations 528, 280, and 710 pg/ml in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively). At week 48, levonorgestrel concentration were 57% lower in the efavirenz group, and 14% higher in the nevirapine group when compared to the ART-naive group (levonorgestrel concentrations 580, 247, and 664 pg/mL in the ART-naive, efavirenz, and nevirapine groups, respectively). Three pregnancies (3/20, 15%) occurred in the efavirenz group between weeks 36 and 48. No pregnancies occurred in the ART-naive or nevirapine groups.<br><em>Unintended pregnancies observed with combined use of the levonorgestrel contraceptive implant and efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy: a three-arm pharmacokinetic evaluation over 48 weeks.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) decreased lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 27%, 19% and 46%, respectively. An increase in the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules) or 500/125 mg (5 tablets with 100/25 mg each) twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine. Dose adjustment of nevirapine is not required when co-administered with lopinavir. Coadministration of nevirapine and lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution (300/75 mg/m2) to paediatric patients decreased lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 22%, 14% and 55%, respectively. For children, increase of the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir to 300/75 mg/m2 twice daily with food should be considered when used in combination with nevirapine, particularly for children in whom reduced susceptibility to lopinavir/ritonavir is suspected. <br /><em>Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.</em></p>
<div>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with Kaletra (400/100 mg lopinavir/ritonavir twice daily) in 22 patients was compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone in 19 patients. Patients taking nevirapine had 27%, 19% and 51% lower lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets to 500/125 mg twice-daily is recommended when used in combination with nevirapine. A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution to 533/133 mg twice daily with food is recommended in combination with nevirapine.<br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></div>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess the influence of nevirapine on lopinavir pharmacokinetics in order to optimise dosing regimens. The study included 15 HIV+ subjects, who received LPV/r (533/133 mg twice daily) and NVP (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by NVP 200 mg twice daily). Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters were measured at week 4 and compared with data from patients (n=23) receiving LPV/r (400/100 mg twice daily) + 2 NRTIs. Following an increase in the LPV/r dosage, the mean &#177; sd LPV Ctrough was 5240 &#177; 4029 ng/ml, which was not significantly different from the mean Ctrough for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI (4272 &#177; 3114 ng/ml, P=0.637). No statistically significant difference was observed in the mean AUC for LPV 400/100 mg bid + 2NRTI or with LPV/r 533/133 mg bid + NVP 200 mg bid (82746 &#177; 41019 vs 100940 &#177; 48871 ng.h/ml, P=0.3286). The findings suggest that an increase in LPV/r dose to 533/133 mg (4 capsules twice daily) is appropriate when co-administered with NVP. Data is awaited on the new tablet formulation of lopinavir in the presence of nevirapine. <br /><em>The steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg bid plus nevirapine (200 mg bid) in adult HIV-1-infected individuals (the NRTI sparing study).

<p>Coadministration of an NNRTI (n=25; nevirapine n=9, efavirenz n=16) with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) resulted in a 39% decrease in lopinavir Ctrough but no change in Cmax, compared in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily alone n=125). There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking efavirenz and nevirapine. There was no difference in lopinavir Ctrough between patients taking lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=125) and those taking lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily, n=32) with an NNRTI (NVP n=3, EFV n=29). There was no statistically significant difference in ritonavir Ctrough or Cmax in patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily with or without an NNRTI but patients taking lopinavir ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily with an NNRTI had higher ritonavir Ctrough and Cmax. The number of patients with lopinavir concentrations below the 3000 ng/ml threshold was higher in those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 with an NNRTI compared to those without an NNRTI. However, the number of patients with suboptimal levels was comparable between those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone to those taking lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg plus an NNRTI. Similar results were observed when a lower threshold (1500 ng/ml) was used. <br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir/ritonavir given alone or with an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

<p>The coadministration of nevirapine to 2 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in lopinavir Cmin values of 1420 and 5240 ng/ml and Cmax values of 3920 and 12300 ng/ml. Mean lopinavir concentrations in a group of patients (n=4) receiving lopinavir/ritonavir alone were 5690 (1420-11120) ng/ml for Cmin and 12400 (3920-17300) ng/ml for Cmax. Nevirapine concentrations were 769 and 1610 ng/ml for Cmin and 2290 and 2490 ng/ml for Cmax. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of lopinavir in combination with nevirapine or efavirenz.

<p>Five HIV+ patients receiving nevirapine (200 mg bd), amprenavir (600 mg bd) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg bd) were studied. Amprenavir concentrations were in the expected ranges (Cmin 560-3090 ng/ml; Cmax 1760-8040 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 13230-75170 ng/ml.h). However, lopinavir concentrations were quite variable (Cmin 620-5980 ng/ml; Cmax 2710-12600 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 998-175140 ng/ml.h) and 40-60% lower than reported by the manufacturer. The combination of amprenavir, lopinavir and nevirapine may result in unpredictable lopinavir concentrations and pharmacological monitoring is advisable in patients treated with such combinations. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and lopinavir in combination with nevirapine in highly pretreated HIV-infected patients.

Both groups (n=18 per group) received the recommended artemether-lumefantrine dose (80/480 mg). The primary outcome was day-7 lumefantrine concentrations, as these are associated with therapeutic response in malaria.

<p>Oral contraceptives and other hormonal methods of birth control, other than DEPOT medroxyprogesteone, should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking nevirapine, since nevirapine may lower the plasma levels of these medications. An alternative or additional method of contraception is recommended. Additionally, when oral contraceptives are used for hormonal regulation during nevirapine therapy, the therapeutic effect of the hormonal therapy should be monitored.<br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of nevirapine and methadone decreased methadone AUC and Cmax by 60% and 42%, respectively. Methadone-maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. <br /><em>Viramune Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>In a controlled pharmacokinetic study with 9 patients receiving chronic methadone to whom steady state nevirapine therapy was added, the clearance of methadone was increased by 3-fold resulting in symptoms of withdrawal, requiring dose adjustments in 10 mg segments, in 7 of the 9 patients. Methadone did not have any effect on nevirapine clearance. Increased dosages may be required to prevent symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Methadone maintained patients beginning nevirapine therapy should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal and methadone dose should be adjusted accordingly. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with methadone (racemic n=11; (R)-methadone n=9) significantly decreased the methadone mean dose-adjusted AUC by 41%. AUC reductions were similar in patients taking the racemic methadone (37%) or the R-enantiomer (44%). 14/20 patients required additional methadone due to withdrawal symptoms. However, the median dose increase (15%) was less than that which would be expected from the PK data. <br /><em>Nevirapine significantly reduces the levels of racemic methadone and (R)-methadone in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Stocker H, Kruse G, Kreckel P, et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2004, 48: 4148-4153.</em></p>
<p>Administration of nevirapine (200 mg bd) to 8 HIV-infected injection drug users who also received methadone resulted in a significant reduction in methadone exposure after 7-10 days of therapy. There was a 36% reduction in mean methadone Cmax (from 676 to 435 ng/ml) and mean methadone AUC reduced from 12024 to 5713 ng/ml.h. 6/8 patients complained of symptoms of methadone withdrawal and required a mean increase in methadone dose of 16%.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions of nevirapine and methadone and guidelines for use of nevirapine to treat injection drug users.

<p>Ten HIV+ patients on methadone maintenance commenced nevirapine under dose escalation to a final dose of 400 mg once daily. 9/10 patients developed acute opioid withdrawal symptoms beginning 4-14 days after commencing nevirapine. Methadone AUC decreased by ~50% and a mean methadone increase of 22% was required.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of methadone in drug users taking methadone who start HAART with nevirapine once daily.

<p>There are various case reports of patients previously stable on methadone therapy experiencing withdrawal symptoms when nevirapine was added. Altice et al. have shown a decrease in trough plasma methadone concentrations in two patients (patient 1 &#8211; trough methadone decreased from 0.72 to 0.08 &#181;g/ml with nevirapine; patient 2 &#8211; trough methadone decreased from 0.92 to 0.06 &#181;g/ml with nevirapine). <br /><em>Methadone withdrawal when starting an antiretroviral regimen including nevirapine.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em></p>
<p>A case report describes the first two patients to be treated with miltefosine for post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). One was a 26-year-old Ethiopian man who had been treated with sodium stibogluconate, for relapsing visceral leishmaniasis (VL), four times between August 2002 and March 2004. In January 2004 this patient was found to be seropositive for HIV and began antiretroviral treatment with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. Five months later he developed clinical PKDL, with extensive cutaneous, conjunctival and oral mucosal involvement. The second patient was a 42-year-old Ethiopian man who was treated for relapsing VL in November 2003. He too was subsequently found to be seropositive for HIV and was treated with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine from May 2004. He developed a nodular rash of PKDL over his face and upper body 2 weeks after starting the antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of both patients with oral miltefosine, at 100 mg/day for 28 days, led to the complete regression of their PKDL lesions. When checked 3-6 months after the end of the miltesofine treatment, neither patient showed any signs of VL, PKDL or other HIV-associated disease. Significant adverse events were not observed.<br /><em>Successful miltefosine treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis occurring during antiretroviral therapy.

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

After 8 weeks of therapy, there was no difference in plasma clearance of IDV or ABC between the two groups. The clearance of NVP was higher in patients using mycophenolate mofetil (3.25 vs 2.83 L/h, p=0.04). In 12 patients, of whom five also received mycophenolate mofetil, intracellular triphosphates were measured. There was no significant difference in intracellular dCTP, dGTP or 3TCTP concentrations between the two groups.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) and nevirapine (200 mg bd) were evaluated in 13 HIV+, antiretroviral-experienced patients.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Addition of nevirapine resulted in an 8% increase in nelfinavir AUC, a 14% increase in Cmax and a 2% increase in Cmin. No statistically significant changes in nelfinavir levels after the addition of nevirapine. Compared to historical controls, nevirapine levels were unchanged by nelfinavir.

<p><strong>Nelfinavir + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>The influence of nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics on nelfinavir given with low dose ritonavir in once daily regimens was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed after the addition of nevirapine (400 mg od) to three nelfinavir/ritonavir regimens (2000/200, 2000/400 and 2500/200 mg). Since ritonavir strongly increases the ratio of active metabolite (M8) to parent nelfinavir, nelfinavir and M8 concentrations were combined. AUC and Cmin values for combined nelfinavir and M8 after addition of nevirapine were at least equivalent to the same parameters without nevirapine. An increase in combined nelfinavir+M8 concentrations was seen in the arm containing 400 mg ritonavir and this was caused by a significant increase in nelfinavir, but not M8 levels. In both arms containing 200 mg ritonavir, nevirapine cause a significant reduction in ritonavir exposure along with decrease formation of M8. Nevirapine AUC0-24h values were 146-171 mg/L.h and appeared to be higher than reported in sparse literature data. <br /><em>Influence of once daily nevirapine on the pharmacokinetics of once daily nelfinavir/ritonavir combinations in healthy volunteers.

<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines. If coadministration is considered necessary, monitor antiretroviral drug levels.</span>

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

The oxidative metabolites (formed through metabolism by CYPs 2E1, 2B6, 2D6, 3A4 and 1A2) rather than the parent drug are primarily responsible for the haemolytic effects of primaquine. Nevirapine could potentially increase the amount of haemotoxic metabolites. Caution should be used when combining these drugs.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The AUCs of single dose atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) were significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral treatment containing atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz than in healthy volunteers. The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19. A decrease in proguanil exposure via induction of CYP2C19 by nevirapine cannot be excluded. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required</span>

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with rifabutin (150 or 300 mg once daily), in 19 HIV+ patients, caused a 17% and 28% increase in rifabutin AUC and Cmax, respectively, but caused no alteration in Cmin. Nevirapine caused a 24%, 29% and 22% increase in 25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of rifabutin (150 or 300 mg once daily) and nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) was studied in 21 HIV+ individuals. Nevirapine AUC (54.0 &#177; 18.7 &#181;g/ml.h) was consistent with historical controls. Nevirapine Cmax values of 5.8 &#177; 1.9 &#181;g/ml and Cmin values of 3.8 &#177; 1.3 &#181;g/ml were obtained.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with rifampicin (600 mg once daily) in 14 HIV+ patients caused an 11% increase in rifampicin AUC but no alteration in Cmax. Rifampicin Cmin was below the limit of detection for the assay. Administration of rifampicin had a clinically significant effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics, decreasing AUC and Cmax by greater than 50%. Nevirapine and rifampicin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with TB and using a nevirapine containing regimen may use rifabutin instead. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>

<p>Participants were randomly selected to receive either nevirapine at 200 mg twice daily (n=256) or efavirenz at 600 mg daily (n=270), combined with two nucleoside analogues. Sixteen participants participated in an extensive pharmacokinetic study of nevirapine. Nevirapine concentrations at the end of the first week of treatment (on antituberculosis drugs) did not differ from concentrations off tuberculosis treatment, but declined thereafter. Concentrations at steady-state were 4111 ng/mL at week 12 versus 6095 ng/mL at week 48 (P &lt; 0.0001). Nevirapine concentrations &lt;3000 ng/mL were found to be a risk factor for virological failure. Efavirenz concentrations were higher on than off tuberculosis treatment (2700 versus 2450 ng/mL, P&lt;0.0001). The omission of the 2 week lead-in dose of nevirapine prevented low concentrations at treatment initiation but did not prevent the risk of virological failure.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Nevirapine or efavirenz for tuberculosis and HIV coinfected patients: exposure and virological failure relationship.

<p>Patients with HIV-1 and TB were randomized to two different once-daily antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens along with anti-TB treatment. In the NVP arm, 29% of patients had an unfavourable outcome at 6 months compared to 9% in EFV arm (P&lt;0.08). The mean NVP and EFV levels estimated at 1 and 6 months did not significantly differ between favourable and unfavourable responders. Logistic regression analysis showed CYP2B6 516G&gt;T polymorphism significantly associated with virologic outcome in patients receiving EFV-based regimen. Trough plasma concentrations of NVP and EFV did not show any association with response to ART in patients on anti-TB treatment and once-daily ART.

<p>A randomised open label trial was conducted in ART naive HIV-TB patients, randomly assigned to receive either nevirapine or efavirenz based ART with concomitant rifampicin based anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Participants were followed for 24 months. Of the 135 HIV-TB patients, who were receiving rifampicin based ATT, 68 were selected randomly to receive efavirenz based ART and 67 to receive nevirapine based ART. The virological failure rates in the overall population, and the nevirapine and efavirenz groups were 14.1% (19/135); 14.9% (10/67) and 13.2% (9/68), respectively (p =0.94). No significant difference was found between the groups in the rate of clinical, immunological or virological failures. The overall mortality was 17% with no significant difference between the two groups. Except for the lead in period on day 14, the mean nevirapine concentration remained above 3 mg/L. No association was found between plasma levels of nevirapine and incidence of unfavourable outcomes in this group. Outcome of ART in HIV-TB patients on rifampicin based ATT showed no significant difference, irrespective of whether efavirenz or nevirapine was used. Therefore, nevirapine based ART could be an alternative in the resource limited settings in patients with HIV and tuberculosis co-infection.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Nevirapine versus efavirenz-based antitretroviral therapy regimens in antiretroviral-naïve patients with HIV and tuberculosis infection in India: a pilot study.

<p>ARV-naïve HIV-infected TB patients were initiated on an intermittent short-course regimen and randomized to receive didanosine and lamivudine with either NVP (400 mg) or EFV (600 mg) once-daily. Of the 168 patients included (79% men, median CD4 count 93 cells/mm3, median viral load 242,000 copies/ml), 104 were on EFV-based ART and 64 on NVP-based ART. There was a small but statistically significant elevation in ALT and SAP at 2 weeks and AST at 6 weeks after ART initiation. The proportion of patients with rate-limiting toxicity of liver enzymes was small. None had treatment terminated because of hepatotoxicity.

<p>Twenty-two children received antituberculosis and ART concurrently for 4 weeks before pharmacokinetic sampling. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics were compared with those in 16 children aged less than 3 years without tuberculosis. Twenty-two children were treated for HIV/TB coinfection, 10 of whom were girls. One boy was excluded from analysis for nonadherence. The nevirapine AUC up to 12 h was estimated as 52.0 mg.h/L (range: 22.6-159.7) compared with 90.9 mg.h/L (range: 40.4-232.1) in children without tuberculosis (P &lt; 0.001). Predose concentrations of nevirapine were less than 3.0 mg/L in 11 children on tuberculosis treatment versus none of the 16 children without tuberculosis treatment (P=0.001).

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine-containing HAART and rifampicin-containing ATT was assessed in 63 antiretroviral treatment naïve HIV/TB co-infected patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 who were started on rifampicin-containing ATT followed by nevirapine-containing HAART. A control group including 51 HIV patients without tuberculosis and on nevirapine-containing HAART was assessed. 97 out of 114 (85.1%) patients were alive at the end of 48 weeks. The CD4 cell count showed a mean increase of 108 vs.113 cells/mm3 (p=0.83) at 24 weeks of HAART in cases and controls respectively. Overall, 58.73% patients in cases had viral loads &lt;400 copies/ml at the end of 48 weeks. The mean (± SD) Nevirapine concentrations of cases and control at 14, 28, 42 and 180 days were 2.19 ± 1.49 vs. 3.27 ± 4.95 (p=0.10), 2.78 ± 1.60 vs. 3.67 ± 3.59 (p=0.08), 3.06 ± 3.32 vs. 4.04 ± 2.55 (p=0.10) respectively and 3.04 μg/ml (in cases). Good immunological and clinical response can be obtained in HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving rifampicin and nevirapine concomitantly despite somewhat lower nevirapine trough concentrations. This suggests that rifampicin-containing ATT may be co administered in resource limited setting with nevirapine-containing HAART regimen without substantial reduction in antiretroviral effectiveness.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">The antiretroviral efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy and plasma nevirapine concentrations in HIV-TB-co-infected Indian patients receiving rifampicin based antituberculosis treatment.

<p>A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at 3 sites in southern India. HIV-infected patients with TB were treated with a standard short-course anti-TB regimen (2 months of ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide / 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin) thrice weekly, and randomized to receive once-daily EFV at a dose of 600 mg or NVP at a dose of 400 mg (after 14 days of 200 mg administered once daily) with didanosine 250/400 mg and lamivudine 300 mg after 2 months. A total of 116 patients (75% [87 patients] of whom had pulmonary TB), with a mean age of 36 years, a median CD4+ cell count of 84 cells/mm(3), and a median viral load of 310 000 copies/mL, were randomized. At 24 weeks, 50 of 59 patients in the EFV group and 37 of 57 patients in the NVP group had virological suppression (P=0.024). There were no deaths, 1 SAE, and 5 treatment failures in the EFV arm, compared with 5 deaths, 2 SAEs, and 10 treatment failures in the NVP arm. The trial was halted by the data and safety monitoring board at the second interim analysis. Favorable TB treatment outcomes were observed in 93% of the patients in the EFV arm and 84% of the patients in the NVP arm (P=.058).

<p>Patients were divided into two groups: (1) patients receiving nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen (200 mg twice daily) and continuation phase rifampicin-containing tuberculosis therapy (n=27); (2) patients without tuberculosis who were receiving a nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen for at least 3 weeks (n=26). The population pharmacokinetics of nevirapine was described using nonlinear mixed effects modelling with NONMEM software. Based on the developed model, plasma concentration profiles after 300, 400 and 500 mg of nevirapine twice daily were simulated. Concomitant administration of rifampicin increased nevirapine oral clearance (CL/F) by 37.4% and reduced the absorption rate constant (k(a)) by almost sixfold. Rifampicin reduced the nevirapine average minimum concentration by 39%. Simulated doses of 300 mg twice daily elevated nevirapine concentrations above subtherapeutic levels in most patients, with minimum exposure above the recommended maximum concentration. The area under the concentration-time curve of 12-hydroxynevirapine was not different in the presence of rifampicin. 2-, 3- and 8-Hydroxynevirapine were not detectable (LLOQ=0.025 mg/L). The simulations suggest that an increased dose of 300 mg twice daily would achieve adequate nevirapine concentrations in most patients during rifampicin-containing treatment for tuberculosis.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Population pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in combination with rifampicin-based short course chemotherapy in HIV- and tuberculosis-infected South African patients.

Nevirapine Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 14%, 13% and 20%, respectively, in the absence of rifampicin (Cmin 4.86 vs 5.74 mg/L; Cmax 6.86 vs 7.77 mg/L; AUC 70.05 vs 80.03 h.mg/L). When nevirapine was started at full dose in patients receiving rifampicin, therapeutic nevirapine concentrations (&gt;3 mg/L) were attained and there was a potent decline in viral load. <br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Pharmacokinetic parameters of nevirapine when initiated without 2-weeks leading dose in tuberculosis-HIV co-infected patients receiving rifampicin: substudy of the CARINEMO-ANRS 12146 trial in Maputo (Mozambique).

<p>Data from the Liverpool Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) registry were linked with the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) Study. For each patient, the first measurement of efavirenz (600 or 800 mg/day) or nevirapine (400 mg/day) plasma concentration was included. Linear regression was used to evaluate the association of dose, gender, age, weight, ethnicity and concomitant antiretroviral drugs or rifampicin with log-transformed drug concentration, adjusted for time since last intake. Data from 339 patients on efavirenz (34% black, 17% rifampicin) and 179 on nevirapine (27% black, 6% rifampicin) were included. Multivariable models revealed the following predictors for efavirenz concentration: black ethnicity (59% higher; P&lt;0.001), weight (10% lower per additional 10 kg; P=0.002), 800 mg/day (52% higher; P=0.027), rifampicin (35% lower; P=0.039), and zidovudine (25% lower; P=0.010). For nevirapine the predictors were black ethnicity (39% higher; P=0.002), rifampicin (40% lower; P=0.002), protease inhibitor (28% higher; P=0.008) and tenofovir (22% higher; P=0.024). Our analyses confirm that concomitant rifampicin substantially decreases concentration of both efavirenz and nevirapine.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Factors influencing efavirenz and nevirapine plasma concentration: effect of ethnicity, weight and co-medication.

<p>Patients starting ART with or without concurrent antitubercular therapy received either efavirenz or nevirapine at standard doses. Patients developing tuberculosis while taking antiretroviral therapy that included nevirapine were either changed to efavirenz or continued taking nevirapine. The analysis included 2035 individuals who started antiretroviral therapy with efavirenz (1074 with concurrent tuberculosis) and 1935 with nevirapine (209 with concurrent tuberculosis). There were no differences in time to death or substitution of either antiretroviral drug for toxicity with and without concurrent tuberculosis. Patients starting nevirapine with concurrent tuberculosis were at a higher risk of elevated viral load most notably at 6 months (16.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.6%-23.5%) than those without tuberculosis (8.3%; 95% CI, 6.7%-10.0%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.4; and in the combined estimate, adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6). In the time-to-event analysis of confirmed virological failure (2 consecutive values of &gt; or=5000 copies/mL), patients starting nevirapine with concurrent tuberculosis developed virological failure sooner (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.7). There was no difference in time to virological rebound in patients free of tuberculosis and those developing tuberculosis during follow-up while taking nevirapine (adjusted HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-2.0. Virological outcomes were inferior when nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy was commenced while taking antitubercular treatment.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Outcomes of nevirapine- and efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy when coadministered with rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy.

<p>Thirty-two HIV-infected adults with CD4+ T-cell counts &lt;200 cells/mm3 and active TB, receiving rifampicin for 2-6 weeks were randomized to receive either NVP 400 mg (NVP400) or 600 mg (NVP600) per day plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; a 2-week NVP lead-in was performed at 200 mg once daily (OD) and 200 mg twice daily, respectively. From week 4, 12 h PK studies showed that NVP400 had lower median NVP AUC0-12 h, Cmax and C12 than NVP600 (P&lt;0.05). Four patients in NVP600 developed NVP hypersensitivity. At week 48, the median CD4+ T-cell count rise and proportion with viral load &lt;50 copies/ml (intention-to-treat analysis 56% versus 50% and as-treated analysis 75% versus 89%) were comparable. In rifampicin-treated patients, 200 mg NVP OD lead-in led to a significant short-term suboptimal NVP C12 level, while NVP 400 mg lead-in then 600 mg/day was associated with a high rate of NVP hypersensitivity. Forty-eight week efficacy was comparable. Thus, NVP 600 mg/day in rifampicin-treated patients is not recommended.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Pharmacokinetics and 48-weel efficacy of nevirapine: 400 mg versus 600 mg per day in HIV-tuberculosis coinfection receiving rifampicin.

<p>Single center prospective data were collected on all TB/HIV-coinfected patients who received concomitant NNRTI and rifampicin. Of 103 TB/HIV coinfected patients, 26 received concomitant rifampicin with efavirenz (EFV) and 17 with nevirapine (NVP). NNRTIs were commenced after rifampicin in 18/26 (69%) and 7/17 (41%) subjects treated with EFV and NVP, respectively. Of these 88% completed antituberculosis therapy. There were two (5%) deaths, both due to lymphoproliferative malignancy. Three (7%) patients transferred care or discontinued therapy. Of subjects 83% had normal liver function tests (LFTs) and 11% had Grade 1-2 and 6% Grade 3-4 LFT abnormalities during concomitant therapy. Plasma concentrations were measured in 31 patients. The first were within the therapeutic range in 5/7 on NVP 200 mg twice daily, 2/4 on NVP 300 mg twice daily, 3/7 EFV 600 mg once daily, and 7/13 on EFV 800 mg once daily. Concentrations were subtherapeutic in 4/11 (36%) and 3/20 (20%) subjects on NVP and EFV, respectively. No virological rebounds were observed. Of subjects receiving concomitant NVP or EFV with rifampicin, 64% and 80%, respectively, had therapeutic NNRTI plasma concentrations.

<p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted in all ART-naïve patients who were receiving rifampicin. Of 188 patients, 77 and 111 patients were initiated on EFV-based ART (EFV group) and NVP-based ART (NVP group), respectively. At 48 weeks, 77.9% (60/77) in the EFV group and 67.6% (75/111) in the NVP group achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (P=0.140, odds ratio=0.590, 95% confidence interval=0.302-1.153). At 24 and 48 weeks, respective median CD4 counts were 174 and 254 cells/muL in the EFV group and 156 and 218 cells/microL in the NVP group (P&gt;0.05). By binary logistic regression, treatment group was not associated with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (P&gt;0.05).

<p>Sixteen South African patients receiving ART including standard doses of nevirapine were admitted twice for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling: during and after rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy. Geometric mean ratios for nevirapine pharmacokinetic parameters during versus after antitubercular therapy were 0.61 [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.79] for Cmax, 0.64 (90% CI 0.52-0.80) for AUC and 0.68 (90% CI 0.53-0.86) for Cmin. Nevirapine Cmin was subtherapeutic (&lt;3 mg/L) in six patients during antitubercular therapy (one of whom developed virological failure) and in none afterwards. There was no correlation between rifampicin concentrations and the degree of nevirapine induction assessed by the proportional change in nevirapine concentrations between the two admissions. The ratio of nevirapine AUC to the AUC of its 12-hydroxy metabolite was significantly lower in the presence of antitubercular therapy, consistent with induced metabolism. Nevirapine concentrations were significantly decreased by concomitant rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy and a high proportion of patients had subtherapeutic plasma concentrations.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Effect of rifampicin-based antitubercular therapy on nevirapine plasma concentrations in South African adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis.

<p>27 HIV-infected adult Malawians after starting Triomune (stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine) in the second week of tuberculosis treatment were studied. At baseline, 88% had CD4+ T-cell counts &lt;100 cells/ml, all were anaemic and 78% were malnourished. Five patients (19%) died, two withdrew consent and one stopped all drugs due to hepatitis. At 6 months, all but one of the 19 remaining patients had good virological results (16 patients: &lt;400 copies/ml, two patients: &lt;1000 copies/ml) and the median CD4+ T cell increase was 170 cells/ml. Adverse events were numerous, particularly in the first 2 months. Suspected IRD episodes could be managed without treatment interruptions. During the lead-in phase, 59% of nevirapine plasma levels were sub-therapeutic despite good adherence, compared with only 14% during weeks 4 and 8. It is feasible to start Triomune early during TB treatment with good treatment outcome. The nevirapine lead-in phase should be avoided when rifampicin-based tuberculosis treatment is started &gt;1 week beforehand.&nbsp;<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy started early in the course of tuberculosis treatment in adult Malawians.

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Up to 40% of sulfadiazine in the blood is present as the acetyl derivative. About 50% of a single dose of sulfadiazine given orally is excreted in the urine in 24 hours; 15 to 40% is excreted as the acetyl derivative.

<p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but could potentially decrease the levels of tamoxifen and metabolites via induction of CYP3A4 and thereby reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. Coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of cytochromes, markedly reduced tamoxifen and its metabolites concentrations and a similar effect may be expected with nevirapine.</span>

For once daily dosing, samples were  collected 0-24.4 h post dose in the control group (n=18) and the  tenofovir group (n=94). There was no significant difference between the  groups for the time post dose or nevirapine concentrations (5.25 &#181;g/ml  vs. 4.85 &#181;g/ml, control vs. plus tenofovir). <br /><em>Assessment of  drug-drug interactions between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and the  nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz  in HIV-infected patients.

Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for nevirapine to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme induction.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Nevirapine is not an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. </span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased nevirapine plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As nevirapine is an inducer of CYP450 enzymes, there may be potential to decrease levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on limited data concerning the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profile of vercuronium, there is little potential for interaction with nevirapine via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<p>The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin in complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels (INR) should be monitored frequently. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>In case studies of three Italian patients all taking antiretroviral therapy including nevirapine plus warfarin, all experienced increased Quick times. In the first case 5 mg of warfarin per day was able to stabilise anticoagulant activity. In the second case 12 mg of warfarin was required and in the third case only after stopping nevirapine was 7.5 mg of warfarin enough to achieve the therapeutic range needed.<br /><em>Need for increased dose of warfarin in HIV patients taking nevirapine.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with zidovudine (100-200 mg three times daily) in 11 patients caused a 28% and 30% decrease in zidovudine AUC and Cmax, respectively.
