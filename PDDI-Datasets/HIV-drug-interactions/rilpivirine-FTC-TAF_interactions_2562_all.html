                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours. After parenteral use about 60-80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours. Rilpivirine is unlikely to significantly inhibit ampicillin renal elimination. No interaction is expected with tenofovir alafenamide as it results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. However, as emtricitabine is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. When administered orally, there is little potential for significant interaction.&nbsp;</p></span>

<p>Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the fixed dose combination or components of Odefsey, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or expected when Odefsey is combined with atorvastatin. Coadministration of atorvastatin (40 mg once daily) and rilpivirine (150 mg once daily) was studied in 16 subjects. Rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 9%, 10% and 10%, respectively. Atorvastatin Cmax and AUC increased by 35% and 4% but Cmin decreased by 15%. Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin increased by 58%, 39% and 32%; Cmax and AUC of 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin increased by 28% and 23%. (This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily.)<br><em>Odefsey US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, March 2016.</em></p></span>

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Bortezomib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and 2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2, 2D6 and 2C9. Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes. In addition, a clinically relevant effect on rilpivirine concentrations is unlikely as bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of CYP enzymes. However, in healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval. Caution should be taken when using clofazimine with drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interact with bortezomib metabolic pathway.&nbsp;</p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carbimazole is a pro-drug which undergoes rapid and virtually complete metabolism to the active metabolite, thiamazole (also known as methimazole). Despite this potential hepatic metabolism very few data exist on carbimazole drug interactions and a marked interaction is not expected.

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended in the European Summary of Product Characteristics. Rilpivirine is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and is transported by OATP1B1. Ciclosporin inhibits CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 and is a potent inhibitor of P-gp. Coadministration could potentially increase rilpivirine concentrations, though no a priori dosage adjustment is recommended for rilpivirine. Although, ciclosporin can impair renal function this is unlikely to be problematic as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. However, coadministration is expected to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide due to inhibition of P-gp. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Odefsey which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide, but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile.</p></span>

In vitro data indicate that dacarbazine is a substrate of the renal transporter OAT1. However, emtricitabine and tenofovir are unlikely to compete for active renal transport as emtricitabine is eliminated by different renal transporters and tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF.&nbsp;</p></span>

It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Rilpivirine is unlikely to affect the metabolism of empagliflozin and empagliflozin is unlikely to affect rilpivirine concentrations as it does not inhibit or induce CYPs and does not inhibit UGTs. Although an increased risk for bone fractures and decreased bone mineral density has been reported for other sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, coadministration with tenofovir alafenamide is unlikely to be problematic in terms of additive bone toxicity as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic exposure of tenofovir compared to tenofovir disoproxil.</p></span>

Formoterol is eliminated primarily by direct glucuronidation, with O-demethylation (by CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 2A6) followed by further glucuronidation being another pathway. As multiple CYP450 and UGT enzymes catalyze the transformation the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction is low. However formoterol may prolong the QT interval and in healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval. Therefore caution is recommended when coadministering with other medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interfere with formoterol elimination.</p></span>

Lithium is freely filtered at a rate that is dependent upon the glomerular filtration rate therefore no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected. However, since lithium is nephrotoxic, renal function should be monitored periodically as changes in the renal function may impair emtricitabine elimination. Coadministration with nephrotoxic agents is unlikely to be of concern for tenofovir alafenamide which results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. Furthermore, rilpivirine should be used with caution when co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval.</p></span>

No effect on methadone concentrations is expected when used with tenofovir. No dosage adjustments are required when initiating coadministration of methadone with Odefsey. However, clinical monitoring is recommended, as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. Coadministration of methadone (60-100 mg once daily, individualized dose) and rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) to 12 subjects had no effect on rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin. Data from 13 subjects showed Cmax, AUC and Cmin of R-methadone decreased by 14%, 16% and 22%, respectively, whilst those of S-methadone decreased by 13%, 16% and 21%, respectively.<br><em>Odefsey US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, March 2016.</em></p></span>

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Methotrexate is predominantly eliminated via the kidneys, including active tubular secretion (OAT1, OAT3 mediate methotrexate transport in the kidney whereas MRP4 and BCRP mediate methotrexate efflux in the urine). There is no risk for competition for active renal transport mechanisms as emtricitabine is eliminated by other renal transporters and tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. Methotrexate can cause tubular toxicity, however, coadministration of both drugs is unlikely to be of concern as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF. Rilpivirine does not interfere with methotrexate elimination. Note, some methotrexate product labels contraindicate its use or advise caution in immunodeficiency and some contraindicate its use in HIV infection.</p></span>

The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Pazopanib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent 1A2 and 2C8. Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes. Pazopanib is a weak inhibitor and therefore could potentially increase rilpivirine exposure although to a moderate extent. Rilpivirine should be used with caution when co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes, such as pazopanib. In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interact with pazopanib pathway.&nbsp;</p></span>

Ranolazine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and therefore could potentially increase rilpivirine. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended. However, caution is warranted when coadministering these drugs due to the risk of QT interval prolongation. In addition, tenofovir-alafenamide (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and inhibitors of P-gp such as ranolazine are expected to increase the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide and thereby increase the systemic concentration. The recommended dose of 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide with P-gp inhibitors is not possible with Odefsey which is only available as a fixed dose combination containing 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide but it should be noted that tenofovir alafenamide has been associated with a large clinical safety profile.</p></span>

<p>Odefsey is contraindicated when coadministered with rifampicin, as significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations occur due to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme induction or gastric pH increase, which may result in loss of virologic response and possible resistance to Odefsey or to the class of NNRTIs. Coadministration of rifampin (600 mg once daily) and rilpivirine (150 mg once daily) was studied in 16 subjects. Rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 69%, 80% and 89%, respectively. Rifampin Cmax increased by 2% but AUC decreased by 1%; there was no change in 25-desacetylrifampin Cmax, but AUC decreased by 9%. (This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily.)<br><em>Odefsey US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, March 2016.</em></p></span>

                      <span><p>Coadministration with rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide has not been studied. Coadministration of rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) and sofosbuvir (400 mg single dose) was studied in 17 subjects. Sofosbuvir Cmax and AUC increased by 21% and 9%, whereas GS-331007 Cmax and AUC increased by 6% and 1%. Rilpivirine Cmax and AUC increased by 5% and 6%, but Cmin decreased by 1%. No dose adjustment of sofosbuvir or rilpivirine is required. In addition, no clinically significant interactions were observed when sofosbuvir was coadministered with emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide. Coadministration of emtricitabine (200 mg once daily with efavirenz and tenofovir) and sofosbuvir (400 mg single dose) was studied in 16 subjects. Sofosbuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 19% and 6%, respectively, with Cmax and AUC of GS-331007 (the major circulating sofosbuvir metabolite) decreasing by 23% and 16%, respectively. Emtricitabine Cmax and AUC decreased by 3% and 1%, but Cmin increased by 4%. Coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/400 mg once daily) and tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg once daily) increased tenofovir alafenamide AUC by 32%, the pharmacokinetics of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was not significantly changed.&nbsp;</p></span>

Tacrolimus could potentially increase rilpivirine concentrations although to a modest extent. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended. In addition, tacrolimus can impair renal function but this is unlikely to be problematic as tenofovir alafenamide results in 90% lower systemic levels of tenofovir compared to tenofovir-DF.&nbsp;</p></span>

                      <span><p>Coadministration has not been studied. Tamoxifen induces CYP3A4 and could potentially decrease rilpivirine exposure. No effect on tamoxifen is expected as rilpivirine does not inhibit or induce cytochromes. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 &gt; 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interact with tamoxifen metabolic pathway.&nbsp;</p></span>

Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. In vitro data indicate that rilpivirine is an inhibitor of BCRP and thus may increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.

Zuclopenthixol is metabolized by sulphoxidation, N-dealkylation (via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and glucuronidation. Rilpivirine, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide do not interact with this metabolic pathway. However, rilpivirine should be used with caution when co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval.</p></span>
