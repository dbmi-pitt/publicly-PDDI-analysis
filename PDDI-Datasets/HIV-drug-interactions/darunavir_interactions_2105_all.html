                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. A clinical study with ritonavir suggests there is potential for levels of albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide to be reduced when co-administered with ritonavir, potentially lowering clinical effect of albendazole.

                    <span><p>Ritonavir, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have the potential to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of albendazole; albendazole sulfoxide. The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but may result in decreased efficacy, especially in the treatment of systemic helminth infections. Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

<div><br />The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. In an interaction study of single-dose bedaquiline and multiple-dose lopinavir/ritonavir, bedaquiline AUC was increased by 22%. This increase is likely due to ritonavir and increases in bedaquiline exposure would be expected when coadministered with other ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. The combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If coadministration is necessary, clinical monitoring including frequent electrocardiogram assessment and monitoring of transaminases is recommended. There are no clinical data on the safety and efficacy of bedaquiline when co-administered with antiretroviral agents.</span>

                    <span><p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominately by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to PPX, both mediated by cytochrome P4503A4. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<div><br />Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Darunavir and ritonavir are both inhibitors of the CYP3A isoform. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.<br /><em>Prezista&#174; (darunavir) film-coated tablets, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, updated September 2012</em></div></div></span>

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

                    <span><div>The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

<div>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

<div>A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.<br /><em>Prezista&#174; (darunavir) film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, updated September 2012</em></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. An alternative to clopidogrel should be considered.</span>

His home medications included darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, isoniazid, pyridoxine, clopidogrel, aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, valsartan, sertraline, tamsulosin and esomeprazole. Potential drug-drug interactions between isoniazid and clopidogrel, and ritonavir and clopidogrel were identified that could interfere with clopidogrel activation. Based on this, platelet function testing was completed and impaired clopidogrel response was seen on two platelet function tests.

The interaction with darunavir/ritonavir has not been studied, but coadministration is expected to increase colchicine concentrations. Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) significantly increased colchicine Cmax (2.7-fold) and AUC (3.5-fold) when given with a single dose of colchicine (0.6 mg). Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be coadministered colchicine. A reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function. When coadministered for treatment of gout flares, the recommended dosage is 0.6 mg (1 tablet) for 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. The dose is to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. When coadministered for prophylaxis of gout flares, if the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day; if the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. As an inhibitor of CYP3A, darunavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by two pathways. Activation (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is catalyzed by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. In theory, darunavir/ritonavir could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway which may increase the efficacy and the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Careful monitoring of cyclophosphamide related side effects is recommended.</span>

Concomitant administration of a P-gp inducer (such as rifampicin, St. John&#180;s wort (Hypericum perforatum), carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran concentrations and should be avoided. Protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, tipranavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir affect P-glycoprotein (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran.<br /><em>Pradaxa Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International, January 2013.</em> </span>

Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p></span></span>

                      <span>Coadministration with ritonavir may increase concentrations of docetaxel and increase the risk of severe toxicities.

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

<p>Efavirenz in combination with darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily may result in sub-optimal darunavir Cmin. If efavirenz is to be used in combination with darunavir/ritonavir, the darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily regimen should be used. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (at a dose lower than recommended or with a different dosing regimen) increased efavirenz AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 21%, 15% and 17%, respectively. Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were decreased by 13%, 15% and 31%, respectively. Efavirenz decreases the plasma concentrations of darunavir as a result of CYP3A4 induction. Darunavir/ritonavir increases the plasma concentrations of efavirenz as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical monitoring for central nervous system toxicity associated with increased exposure to efavirenz may be indicated when darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir is given in combination with efavirenz. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>The interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and efavirenz was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Darunavir exposure decreased and efavirenz exposure increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 15%, 13% and 31%, respectively. Efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 15%, 21% and 17%, respectively. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) on a once daily regimen of darunavir/ritonavir (900/100 mg) was investigated in 12 HIV- subjects. Coadministration decreased darunavir trough concentration by 57% (p&lt;0.001), AUC decreased by 14% (p=0.05) and Cmax decreased by 8% (p=0.23). Ritonavir trough concentrations and AUC were also significantly reduced by 54% and 26%, respectively. There was no significant effect on efavirenz trough concentrations (1% increase), AUC (9% decrease) or Cmax (20% decrease), but efavirenz half life was significantly increased by 66% in the combination phase. Although trough concentrations of darunavir were significantly reduced, all remained above the EC50 of wild-type virus. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of darunavir at 900 milligrams and ritonavir at 100 milligrams once daily when coadministered with efavirenz at 600 milligrams once daily in healthy volunteers.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between a non-licensed dose of darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg twice daily) was investigated in HIV-negative subjects. In the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz Cmin and Cmax increased by ~17% and AUC increased by 21%. Coadministration decreased darunavir Cmin by 31% and decreased AUC by 13%. Since the clinical significance of the changes in AUC and Cmin seen during coadministration has not been established, this combination should be used with caution.

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

<p>Patients receiving estrogen-based contraceptives should be instructed to use alternate contraceptive measures during therapy with darunavir/ritonavir because hormonal levels may decrease. Coadministration of ethinylestradiol/norethindrone (0.035/1.0 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 women.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Fluphenazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. Darunavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levels of fluphenazine via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing likelihood of adverse events. Cardiac side effects including acute QT prolongation have been observed rarely with darunavir treatment. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.  The impact on the PR interval of coadministration with ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval has not been evaluated. Coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir and fluphenazine should be undertaken with caution.

<div>Cardiac side effects including acute prolonged electrocardiogram QT, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia and palpitations have been observed rarely with darunavir treatment. A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6&nbsp;may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.<br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, September 2012.</em></div>
<p>Fluphenazine is metabolised by P450 2D6 and is itself an inhibitor of this drug metabolising enzyme. The plasma concentrations and the effects of fluphenazine may therefore be increased and prolonged by drugs that are either the substrates or inhibitors of this P450 isoform, possibly resulting in severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects. The effects of phenothiazines on the heart are dose-related. ECG changes with prolongation of the QT interval and T-Wave changes have been reported commonly in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have also occurred after overdosage. Sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths have been reported in hospitalised psychotic patients receiving phenothiazines. The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, concurrent use of these drugs and fluphenazine is contraindicated.<br /><em>Modecate Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-aventis, December 2011.</em></p></span>

Coadministration had no effect on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations, but decreased midazolam AUC by 34% and Cmax by 31%. The results suggest that Gingko biloba extract is unlikely to reduce exposure of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, but unboosted regimens may be affected. <br /><em>Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on lopinavir, midazolam and fexofenadine pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Darunavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of darunavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as darunavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al. Drug Metab Dispos 1999; 27: 1309-18</em></p>
<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Imatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYPs 1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In vitro data indicate that imatinib inhibits CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. The effect of darunavir/ritonavir on imatinib exposure is difficult to predict as clinical studies with CYP3A4 inhibitors have yielded differing results. Ketoconazole increased imatinib exposure; however, ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) had no significant effect on imatinib exposure. Use with caution and monitor for imatinib related side effects. Imatinib may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, such as darunavir.</span>

There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window.

<p>There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.<br /><em>Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.</em></p>
<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (at a dose lower than recommended or with a different dosing regimen) increased ketoconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 212%, 111% and 868%, respectively. Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were increased by 42%, 21% and 73%, respectively. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended. When coadministration is required the daily dose of ketoconazole should not exceed 200 mg. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, <em>June 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 15 subjects. Both darunavir and ketoconazole exposure was increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 21%, 42% and 73%, respectively (data from 14 subjects). Ketoconazole Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 111%, 212% and 868%, respectively. When co-administration is required, the daily dose of ketoconazole should not exceed 200 mg.<br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>The interaction between ketoconazole and darunavir (alone and in combination with low-dose ritonavir) was studied in HIV-healthy volunteers. Group 1 received darunavir (400 mg twice daily) alone and plus ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily). Group 2 received darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) alone, ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) alone, and darunavir/ritonavir/ketoconazole (400/100/200 mg twice daily). All treatments were with food for 6 days with steady-state pharmacokinetics following the morning dose on day 7. When given without ritonavir, ketoconazole increased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 155%, 78% and 179%, respectively, compared with darunavir alone. In the presence of ritonavir, ketoconazole increased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 42%, 21% and 73%, respectively, relative to darunavir/ritonavir treatment. Ketoconazole pharmacokinetics was unchanged by co-administration with darunavir alone, but AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 212%, 111% and 868%, respectively, during co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir compared with ketoconazole alone. The increase in darunavir exposure by ketoconazole was lower than that observed previously with ritonavir. However, a maximum ketoconazole dose of 200 mg/day is recommended if used concomitantly with darunavir/ritonavir. This study was performed with a darunavir dose lower than the licensed dose; the authors indicate that that no dose adjustments from the licensed dose (600/100 mg twice daily) are required for darunavir/ritonavir when coadministered with ketoconazole. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir and ketoconazole following co-administration in HIV-healthy volunteers.

                      <span>No clinically significant interactions were observed when darunavir/ritonavir and ledipasvir or sofosbuvir were coadministered. Coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) and ledipasvir alone (90 mg once daily) increased ledipasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 45%, 39% and 39%; coadministration with sofosbuvir alone (400 mg single dose) increased sofosbuvir Cmax and AUC by 45% and 34%, respectively. No effect on darunavir or ritonavir pharmacokinetics was observed. Note, coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and regimens containing a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir and tenofovir may increase tenofovir concentrations. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions including frequent renal monitoring. </span>

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Levonorgestrel is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is glucuronidated to a minor extent. An analysis of 570 HIV-infected women in Swaziland using levonorgestrel implant and lopinavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or efavirenz based regimens suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of levonorgestrel implant. Similarly, darunavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception. </span>

                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

Coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir and methadone (individual doses ranging from 55 to 150 mg once daily) decreased the AUC, Cmin and Cmax of R-methadone by 16%, 15% and 24% respectively. No adjustment of methadone dosage is required when initiating coadministration with darunavir/ritonavir. However, increased methadone dose may be necessary when concomitantly administered for a longer period of time due to induction of metabolism by ritonavir. Therefore, clinical monitoring is recommended, as maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, <em>June 2012</em>.</em></p>

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

As darunavir/ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier).

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>Based on between study comparison, coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) to 8 subjects increased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 24%, 40% and 2%, respectively. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>An open label, randomised cross over study investigated the pharmacokinetic interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and nevirapine. Nineteen HIV+ patients received nevirapine (200 mg twice daily with 2 or more NRTIs) in combination with darunavir oral solution (300 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily) or darunavir tablet (400 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily) in two 14-day sessions. At these lower than licensed doses, darunavir/ritonavir increased mean nevirapine AUC by 27% (least square means ratio 1.27; 95% confidence interval 1.02, 1.58). Mean darunavir and ritonavir exposures were similar to historical data. No dose adjustments are considered to be required based on a) dose proportionality of darunavir PK and b) coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is generally well tolerated. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between nevirapine and darunavir with low-dose ritonavir in HIV-1-infected patients.

<p>Data from TDM and a population PK approach were used to examine the influence of coadministered drugs on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in a cohort of 51 patients. In the final one compartment model there was relationship between nevirapine clearance and the presence of darunavir in the regimen. There was a significant decrease in clearance (CL/f, 3.84 &#177; 0.92 vs 2.76 &#177; 1.00 L/h) and an increase in the mean nevirapine trough plasma concentrations (3.68 &#177; 1.69 vs 5.35 &#177; 3.20 mg/L) in combination with darunavir. The limitations of the study are that it is TDM data and small numbers. The advantage is that these are results obtained with the recommended twice daily dose of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) rather than the lower doses (300/100 or 400/100 mg) used in the early interaction studies. <br /><em>Influence of darunavir coadministration on nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients: a population approach.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br />Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Norelgestromin is metabolized to norgestrel (possibly by CYP3A4). A study of transdermally delivered ethinylestradiol and norelgestromin in HIV-infected women on stable lopinavir/ritonavir showed lopinavir/ritonavir decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 45% but increased norelgestromin AUC by 83% compared to a control group not on cART. Similarly, darunavir/ritonavir could potentially increase norelgestromin exposure but reduce ethinylestradiol exposure which may compromise the contraceptive efficacy. Thus, caution is recommended and additional contraceptive measures should be used.</span>

<p>Patients receiving estrogen-based contraceptives should be instructed to use alternate contraceptive measures during therapy with darunavir/ritonavir because hormonal levels may decrease. Coadministration of ethinylestradiol/norethindrone (0.035/1.0 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 11 women. Ethinylestradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 32%, 44% and 62%, respectively. Norethindrone Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 10%, 14% and 30%, respectively. Alternative methods of nonhormonal contraception are recommended. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of multiple doses of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the steady state pharmacokinetics of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone was studied in 19 HIV-negative women. When given with darunavir/ritonavir, ethinyl estradiol Cmin, Cmax and AUC decreased by 62%, 32% and 44%, respectively and norethindrone decreased by 30%, 10% and 14%, respectively. Five participants discontinued the study due to grade 2 cutaneous events during treatment with darunavir/ritonavir and the contraceptive. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be used when oestrogen-based contraceptives are co-administered with darunavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone and darunavir with low-dose ritonavir in healthy women.

<p>The effect of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) and omeprazole (20 mg once daily) on the plasma pharmacokinetics of a non-licensed dose of darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was investigated in 12 HIV-negative volunteers. Treatment was given for 4 days with an additional morning dose on day 5, and regimens were separated by a washout period of 7 days.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent 3A4. In vitro data suggest that ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 and, therefore, darunavir/ritonavir could potentially increase paclitaxel exposure. However, the European SPC for darunavir states that coadministration may decrease concentrations of paclitaxel which could decrease or shorten its therapeutic effect. As it is unclear whether paclitaxel exposure wil increase or decrease, monitor paclitaxel induced toxicity and therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Although metabolism of penicillamine is not fully elucidated, multiple mechanisms and sites of metabolism are thought to be involved. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions with darunavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

<div>Coadministration of pravastatin (40 mg single dose) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 14 subjects. Pravastatin Cmax increased by 63%. The mean increase in pravastatin AUC was 81%; however, pravastatin AUC increased by up to 5-fold in some subjects.

<p>The effect of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of pravastatin (40 mg) was investigated in 14 HIV- subjects. Pravastatin Cmax and AUC increased by 63% and 81% respectively. However, substantial interindividual variability in pravastatin exposure was observed (treatment ratios from 0.57 to 6.79) and in 4/14 subjects, pravastatin exposure was increased by over 200%. Coadministration was generally well tolerated but, due to the variation in response, it is recommended to start with the lowest possible dose of pravastatin and titrate as necessary whilst monitoring safety. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between the new HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (TMC114) and the lipid-lowering agent pravastatin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The AUCs of single dose atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) were significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral treatment containing atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz than in healthy volunteers. The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 and other boosted PIs could possibly decrease proguanil exposure via the same mechanism. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

                    <span>Pyridostigmine bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterases and is also metabolised in the liver. Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

                    <span><p>Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing raltegravir + darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. In some studies, co-administration of ISENTRESS with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.&nbsp;<br /><em>Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, November 2014.</em></p>
<div>Raltegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT2B7) or P-glycoprotein (e.g., protease inhibitors). In drug interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing raltegravir + darunavir/ritonavir compared to subjects receiving raltegravir without darunavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash.<br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, February 2015.</em></div>
<p>Darunavir trough concentrations were determined in 117 samples from 55 HIV+ patients receiving darunavir containing regimens with either a NRTI or raltegravir. Mean (&#177; sd) darunavir concentrations were higher in the NRTI subjects than in the raltegravir subjects (4.20 &#177; 2.35 vs 2.63 &#177; 84 mg/L). However, the proportion of subjects with undetectable viral loads (&lt;50 copies/ml) was higher in the raltegravir group than in the NRTI group. After adjusting for time from last drug intake and concomitant drugs, a multivariate linear regression model confirmed raltegravir to be independently related to lower darunavir concentrations. The mechanism of this unexpected interaction remains to be determined, but it does not appear to be virologically significant. <br /><em>Unexpected drug interaction between darunavir and raltegravir.

<p>Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 18 subjects. Contrary to clinical experience in HIV+ patients, eight subjects presented with a clinical adverse experience of rash, which progressed from mild/moderate to serious in one subject. Only six subjects completed the study. Based on these limited pharmacokinetic data, raltegravir AUC decreased by 29%, Cmax decreased by 33% and Cmin increased by 38% (the latter parameter showing very marked variability).

<p>The effect of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) and omeprazole (20 mg once daily) on the plasma pharmacokinetics of a non-licensed dose of darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was investigated in 12 HIV-negative volunteers. Treatment was given for 4 days with an additional morning dose on day 5, and regimens were separated by a washout period of 7 days.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

                      <span>Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor, thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration in HIV-negative subjects increased darunavir AUC by ~50-60%.

                    <span><p>Rifabutin is an inducer and substrate of CYP3A. An increase of systemic exposure to darunavir was observed when darunavir coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir was coadministered with rifabutin 150 mg (once every other day). Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 53%, 39% and 68%, respectively. Based upon the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir, the increase in darunavir exposure in the presence of rifabutin does not warrant a dose adjustment for darunavir/ritonavir. The interaction trial showed a comparable daily systemic exposure for rifabutin between treatment at 300 mg (once daily) alone and 150 mg (once every other day) in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with an about 10-fold increase in the daily exposure to the active metabolite 25-O-desacetylrifabutin. Furthermore, AUC of the sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25-O-desacetyl metabolite) was increased 1.6-fold, while Cmax remained comparable. Data on comparison with a 150 mg (once daily) reference dose is lacking. A dosage reduction of rifabutin by 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day (i.e. rifabutin 150 mg once every other day) and increased monitoring for rifabutin related adverse events is warranted in patients receiving the combination. In case of safety issues, a further increase of the dosing interval for rifabutin and/or monitoring of rifabutin levels should be considered.

<p>Coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily alone or 150 mg every other day when coadministered) was studied in HIV- subjects. Rifabutin AUC was comparable when given at the standard dose alone or at the reduced dose in combination. The AUC of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin increased by 9.8-fold when coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir. Coadministration increased the AUC of darunavir by 57% and increased ritonavir AUC by 66%. Adverse events were more common with combined treatment and 18/27 subjects discontinued prematurely.

Simulations with apparent oral clearance increased by 71% and 36% and relative bioavailability decreased by 20% and 45% for darunavir and ritonavir, respectively, were performed for plus rifampicin, 600 mg once daily (n = 1000).

Increasing the dose of ritonavir did not significantly affect darunavir concentrations and is not recommended. The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily Therefore, darunavir must only be used in combination with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, <em>June 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Darunavir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of darunavir. When a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily, there was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir. Therefore, darunavir should only be used in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir to achieve sufficient exposures of darunavir. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Darunavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses:<br />Darunavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment (ART) experienced patients. <br />Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily may be used in some ART experienced patients. (Refer to the darunavir SmPC for further information on once daily dosing in ART experienced patients.)<br />Darunavir 800mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in ART-na&#239;ve patients.</div>
<div>Coadministration of darunavir (600 mg single dose) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased darunavir AUC by 14-fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of darunavir as a result of CYP3A inhibition. Darunavir must be given with ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect. Ritonavir doses higher than 100 mg twice daily have not been studied with darunavir. For further information, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Prezista. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></div>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of ritonavir, darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This phase I open-label study in 12 HIV-1 negative subjects assessed the drug interactions between darunavir/ritonavir given in combination with rosuvastatin. Participants received rosuvastatin (10 mg/day) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) alone for 7 days in a crossover design followed by combination therapy for 7 days with 7-day washout periods. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics and fasting lipids was performed on days 7, 21, and 35. When coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir the geometric mean AUC(0-24 h) of rosuvastatin increased from 109 to 161 ng.h/mL (P &lt;0.005) and Cmax increased 6.7 to 16.3 ng/mL (P &lt;0.001). In the presence of darunavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased by 10% (P = 0.007) and 56% (P = 0.011), whereas HDL cholesterol decreased by 13% (P = 0.006) relative to rosuvastatin alone. Rosuvastatin levels increase in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir coadministration, whereas the lipid-lowering benefits are blunted. The potential mechanism(s) is most likely is inhibition of hepatic uptake and/or inhibition of biliary efflux of rosuvastatin. The clinical significance of these changes requires further investigation, but the authors advise starting with lower doses (10 mg/day) of rosuvastatin when given in combination with twice daily darunavir/ritonavir.<br /><em>Steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions of darunavir/ritonavir with lipid-lowering agent rosuvastatin.

When saquinavir/darunavir/ritonavir (1000/400/100 mg twice daily) was compared to darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily), darunavir AUC and Cmax and Cmin decreased by 26%, 17% and 42%, respectively. It is not recommended to combine darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir with saquinavir. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, <em>June 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of saquinavir hard gel (1000 mg twice daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 14 subjects. Darunavir exposure was decreased and saquinavir exposure was increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 17%, 26% and 42%, respectively. Saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 6%, 6% and 18%, respectively (relative to saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg twice daily alone, data from 12 subjects). Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer saquinavir and darunavir, with or without low-dose ritonavir. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between a non-licensed dose darunavir/ritonavir and saquinavir were investigated in HIV- healthy volunteers who were randomized into two cohorts (panel 1 and panel 2). Panel 1 received darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) alone and with saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily). Panel 2 received saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) alone and with darunavir (400 mg twice daily). Coadministration decreased darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 26%, 17% and 42%, respectively compared with administration of darunavir alone. Relative to treatment with saquinavir/ritonavir alone, saquinavir exposure was not significantly different with the addition of darunavir. Similar findings are expected with the approved 600/100 mg twice daily darunavir/ritonavir dose. Based on the decrease in darunavir Cmin, the combination of saquinavir and darunavir/ritonavir is currently not recommended. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between darunavir and saquinavir in HIV-negative volunteers.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but darunavir/ritonavir could potentially increase saxagliptin exposure as saxagliptin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4/5.  The US Prescribing Information states the recommended dose of saxagliptin to be 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors, (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).</span>

                    <span><p>Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5&#8209;fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.<br /><em>Onglyza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol Myers Squibb &#8211; Astra Zeneca, December 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold. The AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite (5-hydroxy saxagliptin) decreased by 88% and 95% respectively when a single 100 mg dose of saxagliptin was coadministered with ketoconazole. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). The dose of saxagliptin is 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors.<br /><em>Onglyza US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, December 2011.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In an interaction study a comparable systemic exposure to sildenafil was observed for a single intake of 100 mg sildenafil alone and a single intake of 25 mg sildenafil coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir (at a dose lower than recommended or with a different dosing regimen). Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir should be done with caution. If concomitant use of darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir with sildenafil, is indicated, sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours is recommended. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>Co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances and priapism. Coadministration of sildenafil (25 mg single dose) and darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 16 subjects. When compared to values obtained with sildenafil alone (100 mg single dose), sildenafil Cmax decreased by 38% and AUC by 3%. Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse events. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc,&nbsp;June 2012.</em></p>
<p>Sixteen HIV- male subjects were randomized to receive either a single dose of sildenafil (100 mg) alone or a single, reduced dose of sildenafil (25 mg) on day 7 of administration of a non-licensed dose of darunavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Full pharmacokinetic profiles of sildenafil, N-desmethyl sildenafil, darunavir and ritonavir were determined. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Sildenafil AUC was comparable between the two treatments despite administration of the lower dose of sildenafil in combination than alone. Combined treatment was generally safe and well tolerated. There is clear evidence that sildenafil exposure is increased in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir. The authors recommend that a dose adjustment for sildenafil is warranted - sildenafil should not exceed 25 mg over a 48-hour period when coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of repeated doses of darunavir plus low-dose ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in healthy male subjects.

This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces.

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August2007</em></p>
<p>Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed in some patients taking sodium stibogluconate and appears to be dose-related. There have also been reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving higher dose antimonial therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, ECG monitoring is recommended before and during therapy with sodium stibogluconate. Where ECG monitoring is not available, the risks and benefits of sodium stibogluconate therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. Sodium stibogluconate should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias or other risk factors known to predispose towards QT prolongation: for example, those with congenital QTc prolongation or taking concomitant drugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval <br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August2007</em></p>

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir.

<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection.

<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

                      <span>Note: this interaction was studied using a darunavir/ritonavir dose lower than that licensed. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) increased darunavir Cmax (16%), AUC (21%) and Cmin (24%). Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 24%, 22% and 37%, respectively. No adjustments to the licensed doses are required. A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir-DF and a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.

Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 21%, 16% and 24%, respectively. The increase in tenofovir is from an effect on MDR1 transport in renal tubules. Monitoring of renal function may be indicated when darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir is given in combination with tenofovir, particularly in patients with underlying systemic or renal disease, or in patients taking nephrotoxic agents. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, <em>June 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>The interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and tenofovir was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Darunavir and tenofovir exposure was increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 16%, 21% and 24%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 24%, 22% and 37%, respectively. Darunavir/ritonavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can be coadministered without any dose adjustments. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was administered with darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily), there was no sigificant effect on darunavir/ritonavir PK parameters.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. The isoenzymes involved in thiopental metabolism have not been identified. Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for darunavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range. </span>

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Timolol is predominantly metabolised in the liver by CYP2D6. A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased darunavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As darunavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<div>A case report describes a 54-year-old HIV-positive Caucasian male receiving darunavir/ritonavir (900/100 mg once daily) with etravirine (200 mg twice daily) and tenofovir/emtricitabine who was treated for Aspergillus fumigatus with voriconazole 400 mg i.v. twice daily (days 1-7), caspofungin 50 mg i.v. daily (days 8-25) and voriconazole 400 mg orally twice daily (days 12-45).&nbsp; Etravirine, darunavir and ritonavir were continued; however, tenofovir/emtricitabine was stopped due to acute renal failure (replaced by abacavir/lamivudine). The patient responded to antifungal therapy with no hepatic or visual toxicity and was discharged after 46 days hospitalization.&nbsp; Trough concentrations of voriconazole, etravirine, darunavir and ritonavir were measured after 3 weeks on oral voriconazole therapy and repeated 3 weeks after voriconazole discontinuation.&nbsp; Voriconazole concentrations were at the upper end of the therapeutic range, but etravirine trough concentrations increased by 134% when on voriconazole.&nbsp; Ritonavir trough concentration was undetectable and darunavir trough concentration was below the historical reference Cmin while receiving voriconazole. The authors postulate that low ritonavir exposure resulted in diminished darunavir boosting, or that the increased etravirine concentration led to a greater induction effect on darunavir. After voriconazole discontinuation, ritonavir Ctrough increased to the same range as the historical control and darunavir increased 4-fold. <br /><em>Drug interactions between voriconazole, darunavir/ritonavir and etravirine in an HIV-infected patient with Aspergillus pneumonia.
