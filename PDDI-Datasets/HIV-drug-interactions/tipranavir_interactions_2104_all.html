Abacavir Cmax and Cmin decreased by 44% with tipranavir/ritonavir 250/200 mg, decreased by 46% and 36% with tipranavir/ritonavir 750/100 mg and decreased by 52% and 35% with tipranavir/ritonavir 1250/100 mg.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. A clinical study with ritonavir suggests there is potential for levels of albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide to be reduced when co-administered with ritonavir, potentially lowering clinical effect of albendazole.

                    <span><p>Ritonavir, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have the potential to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of albendazole; albendazole sulfoxide. The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but may result in decreased efficacy, especially in the treatment of systemic helminth infections. Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

                    <span>An intravenous (IV) single-bolus injection of alcuronium (0.25 mg/kg = ED95) was administered to 10 patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery during nitrous-oxide opioid anesthesia. Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em></span>

                    <span><div>Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg QD)&nbsp;with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg BID) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 57%, 68% and 81%. Tipranavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 8%, 20% and 75%.&nbsp; The concomitant use of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended. If the co-administration is nevertheless considered necessary, a close monitoring of the safety of tipranavir and a monitoring of plasma concentrations of atazanavir are strongly encouraged.<br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.</em></div>
<p>Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg twice daily for 34 doses) and atazanavir ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 9 doses) was studied in 13 subjects. Tipranavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 20%, 8% and 75%, respectively. Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 68%, 57% and 81%, respectively.<br /><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir and other protease inhibitors has not been studied, but would be expected to increase exposure to other protease inhibitors. Therefore, such co-administration is not recommended. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>

<p>The interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir was investigated in 14 healthy volunteers. Subjects were given atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg twice daily) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg twice daily + atazanavir (300 mg once daily). Co-administration of steady state tipranavir/ritonavir with the first dose of atazanavir caused decreases in tipranavir AUC (39%) and Cmin (70%). At steady state, the decreases in atazanavir AUC and Cmin were larger, being 68% and 81% respectively. Co-administration of steady state atazanavir with steady state tipranavir/ritonavir resulted in increases in tipranavir AUC (20%) and Cmin (75%). The overall conclusion was that tipranavir/ritonavir has a marked impact on the PK of atazanavir and that co-administration of tipranavir/ritonavir 500/100 mg twice daily with atazanavir 300 mg once daily is not recommended. Since the licensed dose for tipranavir/ritonavir is 500/200 mg and not 500/100 mg the question of the impact of increased ritonavir remains conjecture. The increase in tipranavir Cmin in the presence of atazanavir is of interest and points to the additional boosting provided by atazanavir. <br /><em>The pharmacokinetic interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) and steady state tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r) in healthy volunteers.

<div>&nbsp;</div>A prospective, open-label, single-arm, two-period study was performed in healthy volunteers to identify interactions between tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and atorvastatin (40 mg single dose). Atorvastatin AUC was increased by 9.36-fold and Cmax increased by 8.61-fold, when coadministered. Tipranavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not affected by single-dose atorvastatin. The atorvastatin data are consistent with marked inhibition of CYP3A4 and some transport proteins.

Administration of a single dose of atovaquone/proguanil with lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir decreased atovaquone AUC by 70% or 40-50%, respectively; proguanil AUC was also decreased. A possible mechanism was suggested to be induction of glucuronidation by ritonavir and so tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease atovaquone and proguanil. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis.

                      <span>In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone -17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily)  and inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

<div>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

The combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided.

<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM.

Tipranavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 40%, 66% and 100%. Whilst the changes in clarithromycin parameters are not considered clinically relevant, the reduction in the 14-OH metabolite AUC should be considered for the treatment of infections caused by <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> in which the 14-OH metabolite is most active. The increase of tipranavir Cmin may be clinically relevant. Patients using clarithromycin at doses higher than 500 mg twice daily should be carefully monitored for signs of toxicity. For patients with renal impairment dose reduction of clarithromycin should be considered. <br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of clarithromycin (500 mg bd, 25 doses) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg bd) to 24 subjects resulted in increases in tipranavir Cmax (40%), AUC (66%) and Cmin (100%), when compared to historical data (n=68). When the same doses were studied in 21 subjects, clarithromycin Cmax decreased by 5%, with AUC and Cmin increasing by 19% and 68% respectively. 14-OH-clarithromycin was markedly reduced (Cmax and AUC by 97%, Cmin by 95%). No dose adjustment of tipranavir or clarithromycin for patients with normal renal function is necessary. For patients with renal impairment the following dosage adjustments should be considered: for patients with CLCR 30-60 ml/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%; for patients with CLCR &lt;30 ml/min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%. <br /><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Coadministration increased clarithromycin AUC and Cmin by 19% and 68%, respectively; Cmax decreased by 5%. AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 14-OH clarithromycin decreased by &gt;95%. When compared to historical data, tipranavir AUC and Cmax increased by 66% and 40% respectively; Cmin increased by 2-fold. Coadministration increases both tipranavir and clarithromycin exposure. For clarithromycin, this will not cause problems in patients with normal renal function, but patients using clarithromycin at doses higher than 500 mg twice daily should be carefully monitored for signs of toxicity. The almost complete inhibition of the formation of 14-OH- clarithromycin should be taken into account when treating pathogens susceptible to this pharmacologically active metabolite. <br /><em>Interaction studies of tipranavir-ritonavir with clarithromycin, fluconazole and rifabutin in healthy volunteers.

<p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin (500 mg bd) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg bd) were assessed in 24 subjects.

Clarithromycin AUC and Cmax increased by 19% and 68%, with a 5% decrease in Cmin.

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

<div>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

<div>Co-administration of tipranavir&nbsp; with low dose ritonavir, and medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol given in heart failure, is contraindicated. A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (digoxin). At steady state, there was a significant induction of CYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. Pgp activity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, but there was a slight induction at steady state. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (tipranavir) 250mg soft capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated September 2012</em></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir.

                      <span>A clinical study reported that ritonavir had no effect on daunorubicin (liposomal) pharmacokinetics. An in vitro study has shown that daunorubicin was able to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, but was unlikely to cause clinically significant drug interactions via this mechanism. There is therefore little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of daunorubicin treatment and may include dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities. Ritonavir should be used with caution in patients taking medicines known to prolong the PR interval. Tipranavir/ritonavir may prolong the QT interval at supratherapeutic doses.</span>

                    <span><div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<div>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></div>

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of treatment with daunorubicin hydrochloride and may include: dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities (ST-T wave changes, low voltage QRS complex, T waves). Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, endomyocardial fibrosis, pericarditis/myocarditis have also been reported. Careful monitoring of cardiac function before, during and after treatment is therefore recommended in order to identify the risk of cardiac complications as early as possible. Risk factors for cardiac toxicity include active or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/ pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility; or cardiotoxic drugs.<br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></div>

<div>Ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as verapamil or atazanavir) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir. Ritonavir should be used with caution in such patients<br /><em>Norvir&#174; (ritonavir) 100mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Limited, updated January 2012</em></div>

<div>The effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a study in which 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and placebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at therapeutic dose with low dose of ritonavir did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (tipranavir) 250 mg soft capsules Summary of Product Characteristics Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated September 2012</em></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydrocodeine is converted to dihydromorphine (active metabolite) via CYP2D6, to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide via UGT2B7 (major pathway) and to nordihydrocodeine via CYP3A4. The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially increase dihydrocodeine exposure (inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) and increase the conversion to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide (induction of UGT2B7). The net clinical effect of this interaction is difficult to predict. Monitor the analgesic effect and for signs of opiate toxicity.</span>

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

<p>Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily, 8 doses) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg bd) to 21 subjects resulted in decreases in tipranavir Cmax (21%), AUC (31%) and Cmin (42%) when compared to historical data (n=89). Pharmacokinetics of efavirenz were unaltered (increases of 9%, 4% and 2% for Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively). When tipranavir/ritonavir (750/200 mg bd) was coadministered with efavirenz (600 mg once daily, 8 doses) to 25 subjects, there was no change in the pharmacokinetics of tipranavir when compared to historical data (n=100); Cmax and Cmin decreased by 3% and AUC increased by 1%.

<p>The effect of steady-state efavirenz on steady-state tipranavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics was investigated in 16 healthy adult female and male volunteers. After dosing with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily with food) for 10 days, efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was added to the regimen for 14 days. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was done on days 10 and 24. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for AUC, Cmax, and Cmin comparing TPV/r alone and in combination with EFV were 0.97 (0.87 to 1.09), 0.92 (0.81 to 1.03), and 1.19 (0.93 to 1.54) for tipranavir, and 1.03 (0.78 to 1.38), 0.92 (0.65 to 1.30), and 1.04 (0.72 to 1.48) for ritonavir. With the exception of a 19% increase in tipranavir Cmin, which is considered not to be clinically relevant, efavirenz had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of tipranavir or ritonavir. Tipranavir/ritonavir can be safely coadministered with efavirenz and without the need for a dose adjustment. <br /><em>Lack of effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of tipranavir-ritonavir in healthy volunteers. la Porte CJ, Sabo JP, B&#233;&#239;que L, Cameron DW.

In studies where tipranavir co-administered with low-dose ritonavir was used with or without enfuvirtide, it has been observed that the steady-state plasma tipranavir trough concentration of patients receiving enfuvirtide were 45% higher as compared to patients not receiving enfuvirtide. No information is available for the parameters AUC and Cmax. A pharmacokinetic interaction is mechanistically unexpected and the interaction has not been confirmed in a controlled interaction study. The clinical impact of the observed data, especially regarding the tipranavir with ritonavir safety profile, remains unknown. Nevertheless, the clinical data available from the RESIST trials did not suggest any significant alteration of the tipranavir with ritonavir safety profile when combined with enfuvirtide as compared to patients treated with tipranavir with ritonavir without enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.</em></div>

<div>At steady state, tipranavir trough concentrations were approximately 45% higher in patients co-administered enfuvirtide in the Phase 3 trials. The mechanism for this increase is not known. Dose adjustments are not recommended.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></div>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p>
<p>Data from 55 HIV+ subjects who had multiple blood sampling followed by determination of tipranavir concentrations (27 with T20, Group A and 28 without T20, Group B) showed an unexpected interaction. Higher tipranavir concentrations (50% increase) were observed in the T20 group. Modelling of all the tipranavir data pointed to a higher apparent volume of distribution and elimination half-life in Group A. Of importance the authors also described 3 subjects where it was possible to assess the within subject effect and the data were consistent (i.e. an increase in TPV exposure on T20).<br /><em>Unexpected drug-drug interaction between tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/RTV) and enfuvirtide (T20).

<p>The possible interaction between tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and enfuvirtide (T20) was investigated in 15 HIV+ patients (11 with and 4 without T20).

If unavoidable, upward dose adjustments for either omeprazole or esomeprazole may be considered based on clinical response to therapy. There are no data available indicating that omeprazole or esomeprazole dose adjustments will overcome the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Recommendations for maximal doses of omeprazole or esomeprazole are found in the corresponding product information. No tipranavir with ritonavir dose adjustment is required. <br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.</em></p></span>

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

<p>Etravirine and tipranavir/ritonavir should not be coadministered.

Etravirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 71%, 76% and 82% respectively; tipranavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 14%, 18% and 24%, respectively. <br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) was studied in 24 HIV- subjects.

Tipranavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 18%, 14% and 24%, respectively; ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 23%, 19% and 34%.

<p>Fluconazole increases tipranavir concentrations but dose adjustments are not needed. Fluconazole doses &gt;200 mg/day are not recommended. Coadministration of fluconazole (100 mg once daily, 12 doses) and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) to 20 subjects resulted in increases in tipranavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 32%, 50% and 69% when compared to historical data (n=68). There were no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole (decreases of 6%, 8% and 11% for Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively).<br /><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and fluconazole (200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers. Coadministration had no significant effect on fluconazole AUC, Cmax and Cmin (decreases of 8%, 6% and 11%, respectively). When compared to historical data, tipranavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 50%, 32% and 69%, respectively. No dosage adjustment of fluconazole is required. Fluconazole appeared to have a significant effect on steady-state tipranavir, but the clinical significance of this increase in the exposure is not known. It has previously been shown that a 45.6% increase in tipranavir exposure does not result in increased toxicity; however, clinical monitoring of patients receiving this combination is advised. <br /><em>Interaction studies of tipranavir-ritonavir with clarithromycin, fluconazole and rifabutin in healthy volunteers.

<p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of fluconazole (200 mg loading dose on day 1 then 100 mg once daily) were assessed alone, after a single dose of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and in combination with tipranavir/ritonavir at steady state. Following single dose tipranavir/ritonavir there was a 1, 3 and 2% reduction in fluconazole AUC, Cmax and C24h, respectively. Coadministration with tipranavir/ritonavir at steady state resulted in an 8, 6 and 11% in fluconazole AUC, Cmax and C24h, respectively. Fluconazole increased tipranavir AUC, Cmax and C12h by 56, 46 and 104%, respectively; compared to historical data (healthy volunteers taking tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg twice daily at steady state). Coadministration of fluconazole and tipranavir/ritonavir (single dose and steady state) caused no clinically relevant changes in fluconazole plasma concentrations. However, since the C12h of tipranavir is increased by 104% by fluconazole, patients taking this combination should be carefully monitored. <br /><em>The effect of tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg bid (TPV/r) on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in healthy volunteers.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Fluphenazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. Tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levels of fluphenazine via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism, increasing likelihood of adverse events. Tipranavir/ritonavir at therapeutic doses did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic doses. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.  The impact on the PR interval of coadministration with ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval has not been evaluated. Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir and fluphenazine should be undertaken with caution. The European SPC for fluphenazine contraindicates the concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.</span>

<div>The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP2D6 inhibitor. The effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a study in which 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and placebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at therapeutic dose with low dose of ritonavir did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.<br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, September 2012.</em></div>
<p>Fluphenazine is metabolised by P450 2D6 and is itself an inhibitor of this drug metabolising enzyme. The plasma concentrations and the effects of fluphenazine may therefore be increased and prolonged by drugs that are either the substrates or inhibitors of this P450 isoform, possibly resulting in severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects. The effects of phenothiazines on the heart are dose-related. ECG changes with prolongation of the QT interval and T-Wave changes have been reported commonly in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have also occurred after overdosage. Sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths have been reported in hospitalised psychotic patients receiving phenothiazines. The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, concurrent use of these drugs and fluphenazine is contraindicated.<br /><em>Modecate Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-aventis,&nbsp;December 2011.</em><em></em></p></span>

                    <span><div>In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).

Concomitant administration of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.

<p>Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and tipranavir/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and tipranavir/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. A drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir significantly increases plasma fluticasone propionate exposures, resulting in significantly decreased serum cortisol concentrations. Concomitant use of tipranavir/ritonavir and fluticasone propionate may produce the same effects. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported during post-marketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate. <br><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., April 2012.</em></p></span>

                    <span>Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. RESIST study participants receiving tipranavir with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at 24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to 1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between treatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further studied. <br />Fatal and non-fatal intracranial haemorrhages (ICH) have been reported in patients receiving tipranavir, many of whom had other medical conditions or were receiving concomitant medicinal products that may have caused or contributed to these events. However, in some cases the role of tipranavir cannot be excluded. <br />In in vitro experiments, tipranavir was observed to inhibit human platelet aggregation at levels consistent with exposures observed in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (Tipranavir) 250mg soft capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated January 2012</em></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Tipranavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier). Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of tipranavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as tipranavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

                    <span><div>When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I. Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V. (Imipenem and cilastatin for injection) US Prescribing Information, Merck&amp;Co Inc, Issued February 2010</em><br /><br />Approximately 70-80% of the dose of cilastatin was recovered unchanged in the urine as cilastatin within 10 hours of administration of imipenem/cilastatin. No further cilastatin appeared in the urine thereafter. Approximately 10% was found as the N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase comparable to that of cilastatin. Activity of dehydropeptidase-I in the kidney returned to normal levels shortly after the elimination of cilastatin from the blood stream.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<div>Trough concentrations of indinavir, tipranavir and ritonavir were reported in two HIV+ patients receiving the combination as part of salvage therapy; concentrations were obtained at least 2 weeks are starting or changing regimens. Patient 1 had mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 61 ml/min) and was commenced on indinavir/tipranavir/ritonavir (400/500/200 mg twice daily) with enfurvitide, ddI and 3TC. Trough concentrations were 524 ng/ml (indinavir), 63900 ng/ml (tipranavir) and 1492 ng/ml (ritonavir). Following reduction of indinavir to 300 mg twice daily, trough concentrations were 189 ng/ml (indinavir), 75400 ng/ml (tipranavir) and 1029 ng/ml (ritonavir). Patient 2 was commenced on indinavir/tipranavir/ritonavir (400/500/200 mg twice daily) with delavirdine, enfurvitide, and tenofovir. Trough concentrations were 301 ng/ml (indinavir), 120800 ng/ml (tipranavir) and 274 ng/ml (ritonavir). Further studies are needed to assess this combination in salvage. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of indinavir when coadministered with tipranavir/ritonavir.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em> </span>

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Similarly, tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

Linagliptin is mainly eliminated as parent compound in faeces and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway.

The unbound concentrations, which are usually less than 1% at the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4-5-fold after co-administration with ritonavir.

The former dose schedule showed an increase in lopinavir plasma exposure (Ctrough increased from 4.17 to 7.05 &#181;g/ml), consequent to the increased ritonavir dose. Lopinavir plasma concentrations showed a high inter individual variability, suggesting the need for TDM when this combination is used. <br /><em>Effect of lopinavir and ritonavir dose adjustments on the pharmacokinetic interaction between LPV/RTV and tipranavir.

<p>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=79) with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/100 mg) resulted in a 49, 43 and 55% decrease in lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. The clinical relevance of these reductions has not yet been established. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of tipranavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with saquinavir, amprenavir or lopinavir: Interim analysis of BI1182.51.

                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

<p>The effect of tipranavir with low dose of ritonavir on the QTcF interval was measured in a study in which 81 healthy subjects received the following treatments twice daily for 2.5 days: tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg), tipranavir/ritonavir at a supra-therapeutic dose (750/200 mg), and placebo/ritonavir (-/200 mg). After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose. Hence tipranavir at therapeutic dose with low dose of ritonavir did not prolong the QTc interval but may do so at supratherapeutic dose.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (tipranavir) 250 mg soft capsules Summary of Product Characteristics Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated September 2012</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>A single dose of methadone (5 mg) was administered to 15 HIV- subjects alone an in combination with steady state tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily). Tipranavir/ritonavir significantly reduced total methadone exposure (53% reduction in AUC and 55% in Cmax) and showed a stereoselective interaction with the enantiomers, with a greater reduction of the inactive S-enantiomer compared to the active R-enantiomer. The decrease in the systemic concentrations of methadone suggested to the authors a reduced bioavailability consistent with induction of intestinal P-gp. The clinical implications of the study are that HIV+ patients treated with methadone are likely to require an increase in their methadone dose when coadministered with tipranavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Stereoselective pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone after coadministration with steady state tipranavir/ritonavir 500/200 mg twice daily (TPV/r) in healthy volunteers.

The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

<div>A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500mg tipranavir with 200mg ritonavir capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (digoxin). At steady state, potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 was observed. Studies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (Tipranavir) 250mg soft capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated January 2012</em></div></span>

<p>Oxytocin has a plasma half-life of about 1 to 6 minutes which is decreased in late pregnancy and during lactation. Following intravenous administration of oxytocin, uterine response occurs almost immediately and subsides within 1 hour. Following intramuscular injection of the drug, uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes and persists for 2 to 3 hours. Its rapid removal from plasma is accomplished largely by the kidney and the liver.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Although metabolism of penicillamine is not fully elucidated, multiple mechanisms and sites of metabolism are thought to be involved. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions with tipranavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

Four weeks after commencing abacavir, didanosine and tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily), the patient had an episode of seizures and phenobarbital concentrations were found to be 8.1 &#181;g/ml.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The AUCs of single dose atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) were significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral treatment containing atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz than in healthy volunteers. The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 and other boosted PIs could possibly decrease proguanil exposure via the same mechanism. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

                    <span>Pyridostigmine bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterases and is also metabolised in the liver. Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Tipranavir/ritonavir reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir.

<div>An open label study was conducted in 18 healthy subjects who received raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) for 4 days (period 1), tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) for 7 days (period 2) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) with tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) for 4 days (period 3). Raltegravir C12h was decreased by 55% when raltegravir was given with tipranavir/ritonavir, but AUC and Cmax were not significantly reduced. The authors concluded that although raltegravir C12h was decreased, favourable efficacy data in phase III studies indicate that tipranavir/ritonavir may be administered with raltegravir without dose adjustments. <br /><em>Effect of tipranavir/ritonavir on pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) were determined following coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) to 7 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration had no significant effect on raltegravir Cmax (5% increase) or Ctrough (7% increase) but decreased AUC by 28%.

<p><em><strong>LHPG Comment:</strong> concentrations are as cited in abstract i.e. ng/ml, but this should be &#181;g/ml.</em><br />A possible interaction between raltegravir and tipranavir/ritonavir was reported in three subjects stable on antiretroviral regimens containing enfuvirtide and tipranavir/ritonavir. After switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir, all three developed hepatic cytolysis. Liver function tests increased within 2-4 weeks of the switch with AST increasing to 4-10x the upper limit of normal and ALT increasing to 4-40x the upper limit of normal. In two patients, tipranavir was changed to darunavir and liver function normalised. In one patient, with lower LFT abnormalities, tipranavir was continued and liver function was 2x the upper limit of normal within 4 weeks. Tipranavir concentrations were available for this patient and were 46 ng/ml whilst on enfuvirtide, 108 ng/ml after the switch to raltegravir, and 40 ng/ml after improvement of LFTs. <br /><em>Development of hepatic cytolysis after switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir in virologically suppressed patients treated with tipranavir/ritonavir.

It is released from the liver bound to a specific &#945;1-globulin (retinol-binding protein) in the blood.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

                      <span>Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (150 mg single dose) increased tipranavir Cmin by 16% but had no effect on Cmax or AUC. The AUC of rifabutin increased by ~3-fold and that of the metabolite increased by ~21-fold. Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor, thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia).</span>

<p>Coadministration of tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (150 mg single doses) was studied in healthy volunteers. Coadministration increased rifabutin AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 2.9-fold, 1.7-fold and 2.14-fold, respectively. The AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin increased by 20.7-fold, 3.2-fold and 7.83-fold, respectively. When compared to historical data, there was no change in tipranavir AUC or Cmax and Cmin increased by 16%.The small increase in the trough tipranavir concentration does not appear to be clinically relevant. As a result of CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, changes of clinical importance in the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin and its active metabolite, 25-O-desacetyl- rifabutin, occurred. When coadministered rifabutin drug levels should be monitored by TDM and the dose should be adjusted accordingly. Patients should be closely monitored for rifabutin toxicity by clinical judgment and laboratory assessments. <br /><em>Interaction studies of tipranavir-ritonavir with clarithromycin, fluconazole and rifabutin in healthy volunteers.

Failure to correctly co-administer tipranavir with ritonavir will result in reduced plasma levels of tipranavir that may be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect.

<p>Tipranavir must be administered with ritonavir to exert its therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer tipranavir with ritonavir will result in reduced plasma levels of tipranavir that may be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will alter some drug interactions. The recommended adult dose of tipranavir is 500 mg co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir, twice daily. <br /><em>Aptivus Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Tipranavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: tipranavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily (tipranavir with ritonavir should not be used in treatment-na&#239;ve patients). Tipranavir co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir has been associated with reports of clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities. Extra vigilance is warranted in patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Doses of ritonavir lower than 200 mg twice daily should not be used as they might alter the efficacy profile of the combination. Coadministration of tipranavir (500 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (200 mg twice daily) increased tipranavir AUC by 11-fold and Cmin by 29-fold; ritonavir AUC was decreased by 40%. Tipranavir must be given with low dose ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect. Doses of ritonavir less than 200 mg twice daily should not be used with tipranavir as they might alter the efficacy of the combination. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of ritonavir, tipranavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased. See the complete prescribing information for Aptivus (tipranavir) for details on coadministration of tipranavir 500 mg b.i.d. with ritonavir 200 mg b.i.d. There have been reports of clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation including some fatalities. All patients should be followed closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring, especially those with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Liver function tests should be performed prior to initiating therapy with tipranavir/ritonavir, and frequently throughout the duration of treatment.<br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of tipranavir SEDDS (self-emulsifying drug delivery capsules) with ritonavir was investigated in a 14-day, open-label, multicentre phase II study. Patients were randomised to receive tipranavir alone (1200 mg twice daily), tipranavir (300 mg twice daily, n=10) with ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, n=10) or tipranavir (1200 mg twice daily, n=11) with ritonavir (200 mg twice daily). Median tipranavir trough concentrations were 0.803 &#181;M (tipranavir-1200 mg twice daily), 19.2 &#181;M (tipranavir/ritonavir 300/200 mg twice dally) and 56.1 &#181;M (tipranavir/ritonavir 1200/200 mg twice daily). The apparent terminal half life of tipranavir was lower in patients receiving ritonavir. There appeared to be no effect of tipranavir on ritonavir concentrations. <br /><em>A14-day dose-response study of the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of the nonpeptidic protease inhibitor tipranavir in treatment-na&#239;ve HIV-1-infected patients. McCallister S, Valdez H, Curry K et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2004, 376-382.</em></p>
<p>Studies were conducted in HIV- subjects to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction between tipranavir and ritonavir. Addition of 500 mg bd ritonavir to tipranavir 1350 mg bd in 10 subjects resulted in increases in tipranavir Cmax (26 vs 189 &#181;M) and Cmin (0.8 vs 42 &#181;M). In a second study ritonavir was added in a stepwise fashion from 100-500 mg to tipranavir 600 mg bd (n=7) and tipranavir 900 mg bd (n=6). The effect of ritonavir on tipranavir concentrations was dose related. Ritonavir 100 mg or 500 mg, given with tipranavir 600 mg increased tipranavir Cmax by 5- and 7-fold and increased Cmin by 9- and 40-fold respectively. When given with tipranavir 900 mg, ritonavir 100 or 500 mg increased tipranavir Cmax by 5- and 10-fold and increased Cmin by 7- and 45-fold, respectively. Ritonavir concentrations after 500 mg bd were substantially decreased by both doses of tipranavir (Cmax by 70%, Cmin by 90%).<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between the HIV protease inhibitors tipranavir and ritonavir.

Co-administration of tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and rosuvastatin should be initiated with the lowest dose (5 mg/day) of rosuvastatin, titrated to treatment response, and accompanied with careful clinical monitoring for rosuvastatin associated symptoms as described in the label of rosuvastatin.  <br /><em>Aptivus Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, December 2011.</em></p>

<p>A prospective, open-label, single-arm, two-period study was performed in healthy volunteers to identify interactions between tipranavir/ritonavir (500/200 mg twice daily) and rosuvastatin (10 mg single dose). Coadministration increased rosuvastatin AUC by 37% and increased Cmax by 2.23-fold. Tipranavir pharmacokinetic parameters were not affected by single-dose rosuvastatin. These data are consistent with previous findings evaluating this interaction with lopinavir/ritonavir and most likely due to inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP. The authors recommend low initial doses of rosuvastatin (5 mg) with careful clinical monitoring of rosuvastatin-related adverse events when combined with tipranavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Differential effects of tipranavir plus ritonavir on atorvastatin or rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.

The clinical relevance of these reductions has not yet been established.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of tipranavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with saquinavir, amprenavir or lopinavir: Interim analysis of BI1182.51.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially increase saxagliptin exposure as saxagliptin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4/5.  The US Prescribing Information states the recommended dose of saxagliptin to be 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors, (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).</span>

                    <span><p>Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5&#8209;fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.<br /><em>Onglyza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol Myers Squibb &#8211; Astra Zeneca, December 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold. The AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite (5-hydroxy saxagliptin) decreased by 88% and 95% respectively when a single 100 mg dose of saxagliptin was coadministered with ketoconazole. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). The dose of saxagliptin is 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors.<br /><em>Onglyza US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, December 2011.</em></p></span>

Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Tipranavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.

Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 3.2 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 5.6 ms) for the 500/200 mg dose and 8.3 ms (1-sided 95% Upper CI: 10.8 ms) for the supra-therapeutic 750/200 mg dose.

The effects of drugs which act upon platelet formation or function should be allowed to subside before starting long-term systemic lysis with Biofactor Streptokinase. To avoid an elevated bleeding risk, it is therefore essential that the activity of such drugs be neutralised or allowed to subside prior to streptokinase therapy.<br /><em>Streptokinase 750,000 iu UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Beacon Pharmaceuticals, updated August 2012</em></p>
<p>Tipranavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or other medical conditions, or who are receiving medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding such as antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. RESIST study participants receiving tipranavir with ritonavir tended to have an increased risk of bleeding; at 24 weeks the relative risk was 1.98 (95% CI=1.03, 3.80). At 48-weeks the relative risk decreased to 1.27 (95% CI=0.76, 2.12). There was no pattern for the bleeding events and no difference between treatment groups in coagulation parameters. The significance of this finding is being further studied. No pattern of abnormal haematological or coagulation parameters has been observed in patients in general, or preceding the development of ICH. Routine measurement of coagulation parameters is not currently indicated in the management of patients on tipranavir. In in vitro experiments, tipranavir was observed to inhibit human platelet aggregation at levels consistent with exposures observed in patients receiving tipranavir with ritonavir.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (Tipranavir) 250mg soft capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated January 2012</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.<br /><em>Norvir&#174; (Ritonavir) 100mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

                    <span><p>Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

Coadministration could potentially increase sunitinib concentrations, thus increasing the risk of QT prolongation. Coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. If this is not possible, the doses of sunitinib may need to be reduced (refer to sunitinib product label for details) based on careful monitoring of the tolerability.  </span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for tipranavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition.

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Timolol is predominantly metabolised in the liver by CYP2D6. A study in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500mg tipranavir with 200mg ritonavir capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic 2D6 (dextromethorphan). At steady state, potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 was observed. Studies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor. Tipranavir/ritonavir therefore has potential to increase timolol levels. The clinical relevance of this interaction when timolol administered ocularly is unknown, however systemic effects cannot be excluded.</span>

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al. Timolol metabolism in human liver microsomes is mediated principally by CYP2D6. Drug Metab Dispos. 2007 Jul;35(7):1135-41.</em></p>
<p>A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500mg tipranavir with 200mg ritonavir capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (digoxin). At steady state, potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 was observed. Studies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (Tipranavir) 250mg soft capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated January 2012</em></p>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Topotecan undergoes both hepatic and renal elimination. Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased tipranavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>
