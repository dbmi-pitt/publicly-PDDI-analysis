                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A4 is involved in formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. A clinical study with ritonavir suggests there is potential for levels of albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide to be reduced when co-administered with ritonavir, potentially lowering clinical effect of albendazole.

                    <span><p>Ritonavir, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have the potential to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of albendazole; albendazole sulfoxide. The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but may result in decreased efficacy, especially in the treatment of systemic helminth infections. Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

                    <span>Single doses of MAALOX TC (antacid containing aluminium hydroxide) and ranitidine were administered separately with 1400mg of fosamprenavir (FPV). MAALOX TC decreased the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) for plasma amprenavir (APV) by 18% and the maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)) by 35%; the plasma APV concentration at 12 h (C(12)) increased by 14%. Ranitidine at 300 mg decreased the AUC(0-24) for plasma APV by 30% and C(max) by 51%; C(12) was unchanged.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily) and atazanavir (400 mg once daily) when administered alone and in combination (without ritonavir) were investigated in 21 HIV+ subjects. Coadministration resulted in decreases in atazanavir AUC (33%), Cmax (30%) and Cmin (57%), and increases in amprenavir AUC (78%), Cmax (36%) and Cmin (283%). The clinical relevance of these findings will remain unknown until controlled efficacy studies are completed.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of once-daily fosamprenavir 1400 mg plus atazanavir 400 mg without ritonavir in HIV-negative subjects.

<p>The effect of adding atazanavir (300 mg once daily) to fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) or adding fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) plus a second 100 mg ritonavir dose to atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was investigated in 22 healthy subjects. Atazanavir had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir (Ctrough 2470 vs 2290 ng/ml, Cmax 4990 vs 5210 ng/ml, AUC 35600 vs 35200 ng/ml.h; geometric means, alone vs +atazanavir). Ritonavir Ctrough, Cmax and AUC were increased by 37%, 96% and 93%, respectively by the addition of atazanavir. Addition of fosamprenavir and a second dose of ritonavir resulted in no change in atazanavir Ctrough, a 24% decrease in Cmax and a 22% decrease in AUC (Ctrough 741 vs 723 ng/ml, Cmax 4000 vs 3000 ng/ml, AUC, 40900 vs 31500 ng/ml.h; geometric means, alone vs +fosamprenavir/ritonavir). Given no change in amprenavir exposure and a modest decrease in atazanavir exposure, this combination could be evaluated in clinical trials in HIV+ subjects.<br /><em>The pharmacokinetic interaction between fosamprenavir/ritonavir and atazanavir in healthy adult subjects (APC10018).

<p>Trough concentrations of atazanavir and amprenavir were determined over a 12 weeks in HIV+ patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir/ritonavir (150/700/100 mg twice daily, n=9 or 200/700/100 mg twice daily, n=5). Atazanavir concentrations at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were 0.96, 1.66, 1.55 and 1.0 &#181;g/ml for 150 mg twice daily and 1.15, 0.77, 1.36 and 1.07 &#181;g/ml for 200 mg twice daily. Amprenavir concentrations at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were 1.19, 2.19, 2.71, 1.85 &#181;g/ml when given with atazanavir 150 mg twice daily and 2.71, 1.88, 2.58 and 2.43 &#181;g/ml when given with atazanavir 200 mg twice daily. Overall clinical tolerance was excellent and the results appear to indicate that either combination could offer adequate trough concentrations for both drugs.<br /><em>Interaction between atazanavir and fosAmprenavir in the treatment of HIV-infected patients.

<p>ATV and APV trough concentrations were monitored in 7 patients receiving ATV (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily). All patients achieved full virological suppression over 3-12 months. The median ATV trough concentration was 361 ng/ml (range 271-1336 ng/ml); ATV Cmax (mean &#177; sd) was 2634 &#177; 2829 ng/ml). The median APV trough concentration was 2570 ng/ml (range 371-6767 ng/ml); APV Cmax (mean &#177; sd) was 7381 &#177; 2723 ng/ml). Interpatient variability was higher for ATV than APV, though trough concentrations for both drugs were above recommended IC90s.<br /><em>Double PI boosting with atazanavir and fos-amprenavir: favourable pharmacokinetics.

<p>Trough concentrations of atazanavir and amprenavir were obtained 2 weeks after starting therapy in 2 patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir (200/700 mg twice daily) and 5 patients receiving atazanavir/fosamprenavir/ritonavir (150/700/100 mg twice daily). Atazanavir concentrations in the 2 patients on the unboosted regimen were 0.64 and 0.68 &#181;g/ml and were below the range observed for the boosted regimen (0.77-1.63 &#181;g/ml). Amprenavir concentrations in the 2 patients on the unboosted regimen were 2.23 and 2.46 &#181;g/ml and were within the range observed for the boosted regimen (0.40-2.67 &#181;g/ml). These preliminary results appear to indicate adequate trough concentrations may be obtained with the triple PI regimen and further studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics and virological efficacy for this combination and doses are warranted. <br /><em>Favorable interaction between atazanavir and fosamprenavir with and without ritonavir in the treatment of HIV-infected patients.

<p>The coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) and amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) was investigated in 4 HIV+ patients. Median Cmax, AUC and Cmin values for amprenavir were 4830 ng/ml, 51300 ng/ml.h and 1490 ng/ml respectively. Results suggest that amprenavir concentrations are substantially increased by atazanavir and were comparable with (or even higher than) those achieved with boosted amprenavir (600 mg with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of amprenavir given once or twice daily when combined with atazanavir in heavily pretreated HIV-positive patients.

                      <span>In vitro data indicate that beclometasone is a pro-drug which is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone -17-monopropionate. This active metabolite is subsequently converted to inactive metabolites via CYP3A4/5. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily)  and inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. However, coadministration of a boosted PI (darunavir/ritonavir, 600/100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

<div>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled beclomethasone diproprionate (160 mg twice daily) and adrenal function were investigated in groups of 10 HIV- subjects.&nbsp; Coadministration of ritonavir alone increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate (the active metabolite) by 108% and 67%, respectively.&nbsp; Conversely, coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir decreased the AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite by 11% and 19%, respectively. No significant effect on adrenal function was seen with either ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir. Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

The combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If coadministration is necessary, clinical monitoring including frequent electrocardiogram assessment and monitoring of transaminases is recommended.

                    <span><p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominately by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to PPX, both mediated by cytochrome P4503A4. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<div>Additionally, both amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, and ritonavir are primarily metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Therefore, any medicinal products that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may modify the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and ritonavir. Similarly administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir may modify the pharmacokinetics of other active substances that share this metabolic pathway. When fosamprenavir and ritonavir are co-administered, the ritonavir metabolic drug interaction profile may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor<br /><em>Telzir&#174; (fosamprenavir) 700 mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated June 2011</em></div></div></span>

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Carvedilol undergoes glucuronidation via UGTs 1A1, 2B4 and 2B7, and additionally metabolism via CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYPs 2C9 and 1A2. The net effect on carvedilol concentrations is difficult to predict. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir could potentially increase carvedilol concentrations via CYP2D6 inhibition or decrease carvedilol concentrations via induction of glucuronidation.

                    <span><div>The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration of 375.9 (75.8) microM. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.<br /><em>Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Evidence suggests that chloramphenicol is absorbed systemically via topical ocular administration. Any chloramphenicol that is absorbed will be widely distributed in the body tissues and fluids. It is found in cerebrospinal fluid, is secreted in saliva, with the highest concentrations occurring in the kidneys and liver.<br /><em>Boots Infected Eyes (chloramphenicol) 1% w/w Eye Ointment UK Summary of Product Characteristics, The Boots Company Plc, updated June 2012</em> </div></div>

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene. Ghobadi C, Gregory A, Crewe HK, Rostami-Hodjegan A, Lennard MS. Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 2008;23(2):101-5.</em></p>
<div>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

<div><br />Co-administration of tipranavir&nbsp; with low dose ritonavir, and medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance, such as the antiarrhythmics flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol given in heart failure, is contraindicated. A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice-daily 500 mg tipranavir with 200 mg ritonavir capsule administration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (digoxin). At steady state, there was a significant induction of CYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. Pgp activity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, but there was a slight induction at steady state. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor.<br /><em>Aptivus&#174; (tipranavir) 250mg soft capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Boehringer Ingelheim Limited, updated September 2012</em></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. An alternative to clopidogrel should be considered.</span>

His home medications included darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, isoniazid, pyridoxine, clopidogrel, aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, valsartan, sertraline, tamsulosin and esomeprazole. Potential drug-drug interactions between isoniazid and clopidogrel, and ritonavir and clopidogrel were identified that could interfere with clopidogrel activation. Based on this, platelet function testing was completed and impaired clopidogrel response was seen on two platelet function tests. There was no genetic cause (i.e., CYP2C19 genotype) for the impaired clopidogrel response.<br /><em>A patient with HIV and tuberculosis with diminished clopidogrel response. Metzger NL, Momary KN.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. As an inhibitor of CYP3A, fosamprenavir is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by two pathways. Activation (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is catalyzed by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. In theory, fosamprenavir/ritonavir could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway which may increase the efficacy and the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Careful monitoring of cyclophosphamide related side effects is recommended.</span>

Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p></span></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Diamorphine is rapidly metabolized by sequential deacetylation to morphine which is then mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, fosamprenavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease the analgesic effect although to a moderate extent as induction of glucuronidation may increase the formation of the active metabolite. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended but monitor the analgesic effect and signs of opiate withdrawal.</span>

Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

The data demonstrated that echinacea caused inhibition of CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity and induction of hepatic CYP3A activity. The authors indicate that for CYP3A substrates (such as protease inhibitors), the type of drug interaction observed with echinacea will be dependent on the relative extraction of the drugs at hepatic and intestinal sites and will not be readily predicted.

The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as ritonavir&nbsp;may reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required.

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Because there may be an increased risk of hepatic transaminase elevations and hormonal levels may be altered with co-administration of fosamprenavir, ritonavir and oral contraceptives, alternative non-hormonal methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing potential. No data are available on the co-administration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir with oestrogens and/or progestogens when used as hormonal replacement therapies. Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) with an oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol/norethisterone 0.035/0.5 mg once daily) decreased plasma ethinylestradiol AUC and Cmax by 37% and 28%, respectively, and decreased plasma norethisterone AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 34%, 38%, and 26%, respectively. There was no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin when compared to historical data. Ritonavir AUC and Cmax&nbsp;increased by&nbsp;45% and 63% compared to historical data. Clinically significant hepatic transaminase elevations occurred&nbsp;in some subjects. <br /><em>Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, May 2011.</em></p>
<p>Alternative methods of non-hormonal contraception are recommended. Patients receiving hormonal contraceptives should be instructed to use alternate contraceptive measures during therapy with fosamprenavir because hormonal levels may be altered, and if used in combination with fosamprenavir and ritonavir, liver enzyme (transaminase) elevations may occur. Coadministration of ethinyl estradiol/norethindrome (0.035/0.5 mg once daily for 21 days) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 21 days) was studied in 25 subjects. Compared to historical controls, there was no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. Ethinyl estradiol Cmax decreased by 28% and AUC decreased by 37%. Norethindrone Cmax, AUC and Cmin were decreased by 38%, 34% and 26% respectively. Coadministration of ethinyl estradiol (35 &#181;g with norethindrone 1 mg once daily for 28 days) and amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily for 28 days) to 10 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax and decreases in AUC and Cmin of 22% and 20% respectively. There were no changes in the Cmax or AUC of ethinyl estradiol, but Cmin was increased by 32%. Norethindrone Cmax was unaltered, but AUC and Cmin were increased by 18% and 45% respectively. No data are available on the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with other hormonal therapies, such as HRT for postmenopausal women. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p></span>

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier). Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of fosamprenavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as fosamprenavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window.

<p>There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.<br /><em>Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.</em></p>
<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

                    <span><p>When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I. Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels.

<p>Proton pump inhibitors can be administered at the same time as a dose of fosamprenavir with no change in plasma amprenavir concentrations. Coadministration of esomeprazole (20 mg once daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily for 2 weeks) to 25 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. When the same dose of esomeprazole was given to 23 subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily), there was no effect on any amprenavir PK parameter. Esomeprazole Cmax did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir; AUC increased 55% in the presence of fosamprenavir alone, but did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>In a single dose study in healthy volunteers, when fosamprenavir (1400 mg) was administered 1 h after the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine (300 mg), amprenavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 30% and 51% respectively; there was no siginificant effect on amprenavir Cmin.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

An analysis of 570 HIV-infected women in Swaziland using levonorgestrel implant and lopinavir/ritonavir, nevirapine or efavirenz based regimens suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir may not impair the efficacy of levonorgestrel implant. Similarly, fosamprenavir/ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Levothyroxine is metabolized by deiodination (by enzymes of deiodinase family) and glucuronidation. Cases of hypothyroidism have been reported when combining levothyroxine with ritonavir, indinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. This interaction has been attributed to the induction of glucuronidation thereby increasing elimination of levothyroxine. Close monitoring of thyroid hormone parameters is recommended and adjustment of the levothyroxine dose may be necessary if clinically indicated.</span>

                    <span><div>According to current treatment guidelines, dual therapy with protease inhibitors is generally not recommended. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) increased lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 30%, 37% and 52%, respectively, but decreased amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 58%, 63% and 65%, respectively. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (533/133 mg twice daily) and fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) had no effect on lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin when compared to lopinavir 400/100 mg twice daily. Relative to fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100 mg twice daily,amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 13%, 26% and 42%, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 twice daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) to 18 subjects resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 58%, 63% and 65%, respectively. Lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 30%, 37% and 52% respectively. Amprenavir pharmacokinetics in 18 subjects were compared after administration of fosamprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (1400/533/133 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) versus fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks). In the presence of lopinavir, amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 13%, 26% and 42%. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics in this study were compared to those obtained following lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) and were similar (less than 10% change in Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values). An increased rate of adverse events has been observed. Appropriate doses of the combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Co-administration of standard doses of lopinavir/ritonavir with fosamprenavir significantly reduced amprenavir concentrations. Co-administration of increased doses of fosamprenavir 1400 mg twice daily with lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg twice daily to protease inhibitor experienced patients resulted in a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and elevations in triglycerides with the combination regimen without increases in virological efficacy, when compared with standard doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir. Concomitant administration of these medicinal products is not recommended. Kaletra must not be administered once daily in combination with amprenavir.<br /><em>Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Kaletra tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a ONCE DAILY regimen in combination with fosamprenavir. A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use Kaletra tablets or oral solution in combination with (fos)amprenavir. The recommended dose of Kaletra tablets is 500/125 mg twice daily (such as two 200/50 tablets and one 100/25 tablet). The recommended dose of Kaletra oral solution is 533/133 mg twice daily taken with food. Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) to 18 HIV- volunteers resulted in increases in lopinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 30%, 37% and 52% respectively. Amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 58%,63% and 65% respectively. An increased rate of adverse reactions has been observed with co-administration of these medications. Appropriate doses of the combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. <br /><em>Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of amprenavir or fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir was investigated in an open-label study in 10 HIV+ patients. Switching from a regimen of APV/LPV/r (750/533/133 mg twice daily) to FPV/LPV/r (1400/533/133 mg twice daily) resulted in steady-state APV Cmin, AUC and Cmax increasing by 58%, 76% and 75%, respectively. Lopinavir pharmacokinetics were comparable and there was no change in tolerability. <br /><em>Amprenavir and lopinavir pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected patients switched from amprenavir 750 mg bid + lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg bid to fosamprenavir 1400 mg bid + lopinavir/ritonavir 533/133 mg bid or vice versa.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between fosamprenavir and lopinavir/ritonavir was evaluated in groups of HIV-infected subjects receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily, n=8), fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily, n=8) or fosamprenavir/lopinavir/ritonavir (700/400/100 mg twice daily, n=17). Plasma exposure to both amprenavir and lopinavir were significantly reduced when coadministered. Amprenavir mean AUC decreased by 64% (from 42731 to 17381 ng/ml.h) and Cmin decreased by 69% (from 2430 to 876 ng/ml). Lopinavir AUC decreased by 48% (from 95328 to 54384 ng/ml.h) and Cmin decreased by 61% (from 6320 to 2985 ng/ml). Ritonavir exposure was not significantly different between the groups. <br /><em>Combining fosamprenavir with lopinavir/ritonavir substantially reduces amprenavir and lopinavir exposure: ACTG protocol A5143 results.

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

Coadministration may increase mirabegron concentrations, however, only a modest increase in mirabegron exposure was observed with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/P-gp). No dose adjustment is recommended when mirabegron is combined with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp in patients with normal hepatic or renal function. However, a dose decrease of mirabegron to 25 mg once daily in patients is recommended for patients who have mildly impaired hepatic or renal function and who are taking a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.</p></span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

Nelfinavir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin were increased by 12%, 15%, and 14%, respectively, when compared with historical data. Appropriate doses of the combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established.

<p>Coadministration of amprenavir (800 mg three times daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) had a minimal effect (&lt;10%) on the AUCs of amprenavir and nelfinavir, but increased amprenavir Cmin by 189%.

<p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (800 mg three times daily) and amprenavir (800 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Nelfinavir had no significant effect on amprenavir AUC and decreased Cmax by 21%. There was 167% increase in amprenavir Cmin. The increase in Cmin with no increase in overall exposure (AUC) may improve the efficacy of amprenavir while maintaining its good safety profile. When compared with historical controls, there was a 15% increase in nelfinavir AUC, a 12% increase in Cmax and 14% increase in Cmin.

<p><strong>Amprenavir/Nelfinavir/Efavirenz</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Neostigmine is thought to undergo a degree of hepatic metabolism, although the mechanisms are unknown. However, as metabolism also occurs via hydrolysis by cholinesterase and up to 50% of a dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is little potential for clinically significant interaction with antiretrovirals via liver enzyme modification.</span>

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>The interaction between fosamprenavir/ritonavir and nevirapine was investigated in 17 HIV+ patients and data compared to historical controls. Coadministration of fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) with nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmin (39%), Cmax (25%) and AUC (37%); increases were observed in nevirapine Cmin (34%), Cmax (25%) and AUC (29%). Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) and nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmin (19%), Cmax (3%) and AUC (11%); increases were observed in nevirapine Cmin (21%), Cmax (13%) and AUC (14%). Due to significantly lower amprenavir exposure, unboosted fosamprenavir is not recommended with nevirapine. When nevirapine is coadministered with fosamprenavir and ritonavir, no change in dose of any drug is required and this should be considered instead of an unboosted regimen. <br /><em>Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir and nevirapine in HIV-infected patients (APV10014).

<p>Five HIV+ patients receiving nevirapine (200 mg bd), amprenavir (600 mg bd) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg bd) were studied. Amprenavir concentrations were in the expected ranges (Cmin 560-3090 ng/ml; Cmax 1760-8040 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 13230-75170 ng/ml.h). However, lopinavir concentrations were quite variable (Cmin 620-5980 ng/ml; Cmax 2710-12600 ng/ml; AUC0-12h 998-175140 ng/ml.h) and 40-60% lower than reported by the manufacturer. The combination of amprenavir, lopinavir and nevirapine may result in unpredictable lopinavir concentrations and pharmacological monitoring is advisable in patients treated with such combinations. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and lopinavir in combination with nevirapine in highly pretreated HIV-infected patients.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                    <span><p>Because there may be an increased risk of hepatic transaminase elevations and hormonal levels may be altered with co-administration of fosamprenavir, ritonavir and oral contraceptives, alternative non-hormonal methods of contraception are recommended for women of childbearing potential. No data are available on the co-administration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir with oestrogens and/or progestogens when used as hormonal replacement therapies. Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) with an oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol/norethisterone 0.035/0.5 mg once daily) decreased plasma ethinylestradiol AUC and Cmax by 37% and 28%, respectively, and decreased plasma norethisterone AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 34%, 38%, and 26%, respectively. There was no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin when compared to historical data. Ritonavir AUC and Cmax&nbsp;increased by&nbsp;45% and 63% compared to historical data. Clinically significant hepatic transaminase elevations occurred&nbsp;in some subjects.<em> <br />Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, May 2011.</em></p>
<p>Alternative methods of non-hormonal contraception are recommended. Patients receiving hormonal contraceptives should be instructed to use alternate contraceptive measures during therapy with fosamprenavir because hormonal levels may be altered, and if used in combination with fosamprenavir and ritonavir, liver enzyme (transaminase) elevations may occur. Coadministration of ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone (0.035/0.5 mg once daily for 21 days) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 21 days) was studied in 25 subjects. Compared to historical controls, there was no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. Ethinyl estradiol Cmax decreased by 28% and AUC decreased by 37%. Norethindrone Cmax, AUC and Cmin were decreased by 38%, 34% and 26% respectively. Coadministration of ethinyl estradiol (35 &#181;g with norethindrone 1 mg once daily for 28 days) and amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily for 28 days) to 10 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax and decreases in AUC and Cmin of 22% and 20% respectively. There were no changes in the Cmax or AUC of ethinyl estradiol, but Cmin was increased by 32%. Norethindrone Cmax was unaltered, but AUC and Cmin were increased by 18% and 45% respectively. No data are available on the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with other hormonal therapies, such as HRT for postmenopausal women. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p></span>

<p>Proton pump inhibitors can be administered at the same time as a dose of fosamprenavir with no change in plasma amprenavir concentrations. Coadministration of esomeprazole (20 mg once daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily for 2 weeks) to 25 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. When the same dose of esomeprazole was given to 23 subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily), there was no effect on any amprenavir PK parameter. Esomeprazole Cmax did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir; AUC increased 55% in the presence of fosamprenavir alone, but did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>An interaction study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily given in the morning) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/200 mg once daily given in the morning) alone and in combination with 20 mg of omeprazole once daily (given in the evening) was performed in 19 healthy adult volunteers. Full 24-hour pharmacokinetic analysis was performed before and 7 days into the omeprazole treatment. Each study subject took both PIs under the same conditions and therefore each subject acted as their own control. The addition of 20 mg omeprazole as an evening regimen did not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics with geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24 all close to 1. In contrast, atazanavir pharmacokinetics were significantly altered with reductions of 27%, 33% and 27% for Cmin, Cmax, and AUC respectively. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of once daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) and atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) alone and in combination with 20 mg once daily of omeprazole (OMP) in healthy volunteers.

<p>In a single dose study in healthy volunteers, when fosamprenavir (1400 mg) was administered 1 h after the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine (300 mg), amprenavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 30% and 51% respectively; there was no siginificant effect on amprenavir Cmin. Caution is recommended when fosamprenavir is coadministered with H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole). <br /><em>Effect of antacids and ranitidine on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir.

<p>Proton pump inhibitors can be administered at the same time as a dose of fosamprenavir with no change in plasma amprenavir concentrations. Coadministration of esomeprazole (20 mg once daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily for 2 weeks) to 25 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. When the same dose of esomeprazole was given to 23 subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily), there was no effect on any amprenavir PK parameter. Esomeprazole Cmax did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir; AUC increased 55% in the presence of fosamprenavir alone, but did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>In a single dose study in healthy volunteers, when fosamprenavir (1400 mg) was administered 1 h after the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine (300 mg), amprenavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 30% and 51% respectively; there was no siginificant effect on amprenavir Cmin.

<p>The effect of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) on paroxetine (20 mg once daily) pharmacokinetics and vice versa was studied in 23 HIV- subjects. Addition of fosamprenavir/ritonavir to paroxetine significantly decreased paroxetine AUC by 55%, Cmax by 51 % and elimination half-life by 25%; the free fraction of paroxetine increased by 30%, but the Cmax of free (unbound) decreased by 40%. AUC, Cmax, Cmin and half life of amprenavir and ritonavir were similar to historical controls. The reduction in total paroxetine exposure is partly explained by protein displacement of paroxetine. The interaction is likely to be clinically relevant and titration to a higher dose of paroxetine may be necessary to achieve the needed antidepressant effect. <br /><em>Interaction study of the combined use of paroxetine and fosamprenavir-ritonavir in healthy subjects. van der Lee MJ, Blenke AA, Rongen GA, et al.

<p>The interaction between paroxetine and FPV/RTV was investigated in two groups of healthy subjects. One group received paroxetine alone (20 mg once daily) for 10 days, followed by a wash out period of 16 days and then paroxetine with FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily) for 10 days. The second group received the study medications in the reverse order. Results from the groups were combined with 22 subjects completing the study. Addition of FPV/RTV to paroxetine was found to reduce paroxetine exposure by ~60%. GMR values for paroxetine (with FPV/RTV vs alone) were 0.42 for AUC, 0.40 for Cmax and 0.75 for half life. FPV and RTV exposures were similar to historical controls (APV AUC 42 mg/L.h, Cmax 5.9 mg/L, Ctrough 2.5 mg/L, half-life 11.0 h; RTV AUC 4.9 mg/L.h, Cmax 1.0 mg/L, Ctrough 0.15 mg/L, half-life 3.9 h). The effect of APV/RTV on paroxetine may be explained by decreased absorption and/or increased metabolism of paroxetine. Titration of paroxetine to a higher dose may be needed for optimal antidepressant effect. <br /><em>Combined use of paroxetine and fosamprenavir/ritonavir: a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The AUCs of single dose atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) were significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral treatment containing atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz than in healthy volunteers. The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 and other boosted PIs could possibly decrease proguanil exposure via the same mechanism. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir could potentially decrease propofol concentrations. The extent of this interaction is difficult to predict as propofol is a high hepatic extraction drug and therefore its rate of hepatic elimination is in theory more dependent on liver blood flow.

                    <span>Pyridostigmine bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterases and is also metabolised in the liver. Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>Proton pump inhibitors can be administered at the same time as a dose of fosamprenavir with no change in plasma amprenavir concentrations. Coadministration of esomeprazole (20 mg once daily for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily for 2 weeks) to 25 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. When the same dose of esomeprazole was given to 23 subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily), there was no effect on any amprenavir PK parameter. Esomeprazole Cmax did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir; AUC increased 55% in the presence of fosamprenavir alone, but did not change in the presence of fosamprenavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>In a single dose study in healthy volunteers, when fosamprenavir (1400 mg) was administered 1 h after the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine (300 mg), amprenavir AUC and Cmin were decreased by 30% and 51% respectively; there was no siginificant effect on amprenavir Cmin.

Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. It is released from the liver bound to a specific &#945;1-globulin (retinol-binding protein) in the blood. The retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid; these and other metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body. Riboflavin is converted in the body to the coenzyme flavine mononucleotide (FMN; riboflavin 5&#8242;-phosphate) and then to another coenzyme flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD). About 60% of FMN and FAD are bound to plasma proteins. Riboflavin is excreted in urine, partly as metabolites.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (150 mg every other day)  to healthy subjects gave similar plasma exposure (no change in AUC, 14% decrease in Cmax) to rifabutin alone (300 mg once daily). However, AUC and Cmax of a rifabutin metabolite were increased 11- and 6-fold respectively. When compared to historical data, there was no effect on amprenavir exposure. </span>

However, 25-O-desacetylrifabutin AUC (0-48h) and Cmax were increased 11-fold and 6-fold respectively. Amprenavir exposure was unchanged when compared to historical data. The increase of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin (active metabolite) could potentially lead to an increase of rifabutin related adverse events, notably uveitis. A 75 % reduction of the standard rifabutin dose (i.e. to 150 mg every other day) is recommended. Further dose reduction may be necessary.<br /><em>Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics,&nbsp;ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, May 2011.</em></div>
<p>Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg every other day for 2 weeks) and fosamprenavir/rtionavir (700/100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) was studied in 15 subjects. Compared to historical controls, amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 36%, 35% and 17%, respectively. Compared to rifabutin (300 mg once daily), ribautin Cmax decreased by 14%, AUC was unchanged and Cmin increased by 28%. Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin increased by 579%, 1120% and 2510%, respectively. Coadministration of rifabutin (300 mg once daily for 10 days) and amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily for 10 days) to 5 subjects resulted in no change in amprenavir Cmax and 15% decreases in AUC and Cmin. Rifabutin Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 119%, 193% and 271% respectively. A dosage reduction of rifabutin to at least half the recommended dose is required when fosamprenavir and rifabutin are coadministered. When given with fosamprenavir/ritonavir, dosage reduction of rifabutin by at 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or 3 times per week). A complete blood count should be performed weekly and as clinically indicated in order to monitor for neutropaenia. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>A study was conducted in 12 volunteers taking amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily). Amprenavir pharmacokinetics were not significantly affected by rifabutin. Amprenavir significantly increased the AUC of rifabutin by 2.9-fold and the AUC of 25-desacetyl rifabutin by 13.3-fold. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between amprenavir and rifabutin or rifampicin in healthy males.

<p>Coadministration of amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. There was a 204% increase in rifabutin AUC, a 127% increase in Cmax and a 349% increase in Cmin. Amprenavir also markedly increased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 25-desacetyl rifabutin, but had no effect on renal clearance. Amprenavir AUC was decreased by 15%, Cmax was decreased by 7% and Cmin decreased by 15%. The increase in rifabutin concentrations is likely to increase the incidence or severity of adverse events. Rifabutin doses should be reduced to at least half that recommended when coadministered with amprenavir. A complete blood count should be performed weekly and as clinically indicated in order to monitor for neutropaenia in patients receiving amprenavir and rifabutin.<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic drug interactions with amprenavir.

<p>The recommended dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in therapy-naive patients is 1400/200 mg once daily 1400/100 mg once daily or 700/100 mg twice daily. In protease inhibitor-experienced patients, the recommended dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir is 700/100 mg twice daily; once-daily administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir is not recommended in protease inhibitor-experienced patients.

<p>Amprenavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: amprenavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Coadministration of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 64% and Cmin by 5-fold, based on cross-study comparison to amprenavir alone (1200 mg twice daily). Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of 600 mg amprenavir twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Ritonavir <strong>oral solution</strong> should not be co-administered with amprenavir <strong>oral solution</strong> to children due to the risk of toxicity from excipients in the two formulations. Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 2.4-fold and Cmin by 11-fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir (from fosamprenavir) as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Fosamprenavir must be given with ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not been clinically evaluated.

<p>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily, n=11) or fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily, n=15) was investigated in HIV-negative subjects. Ritonavir increased plasma amprenavir exposure to a similar extent when coadministered with either amprenavir or fosamprenavir. Geometric least square mean ratios for AUC, Cmax and Cmin (alone vs with ritonavir) for amprenavir were 3.16, 1.27 and 10.73 respectively, and for fosamprenavir were 3.40, 1.51 and 12.68 respectively, When given with ritonavir, amprenavir mean AUC increased from 8.21 to 26.2 &#181;g.h/ml, Cmax from 3.66 to 4.69 &#181;g/ml and Cmin from 0.12 to 1.32 &#181;g/ml. Increases observed when fosamprenavir was coadministered with ritonavir were AUC increasing from 9.51 to 33.2 &#181;g.h/ml, Cmax increasing from 3.19 to 4.92 &#181;g/ml and Cmin increasing from 0.14 to 1.77 &#181;g/ml. <br /><em>Ritonavir increases plasma amprenavir (APV) exposure to a similar extent when coadministered with either fosamprenavir or APV.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily) with ritonavir (100 mg or 200 mg once daily) were investigated in 36 healthy subjects. Amprenavir Cmin was 38% lower when administered with 100 mg ritonavir than with 200 mg ritonavir (GM 0.86 vs 1.40 &#181;g/ml); however, it remained ~6-fold higher than the protein-binding adjusted IC50 for WT HIV (0.146 &#181;g/ml). Amprenavir Cmax and AUC were also lower with 100 mg ritonavir (Cmax 7.93 vs 8.17 &#181;g/ml; AUC 66.4 vs 73.8 &#181;g/ml.h). The lower dose of ritonavir provided tolerability advantages to the 200 mg dose and achieved equivalent amprenavir Cmax and AUC. <br /><em>Plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics and safety following coadministration of fosamprenavir with a reduced ritonavir dose once daily (COL 10053).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir following standard doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) or high doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg) were investigated in healthy subjects (13 per group). When compared to the standard dose, fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg produced increases in amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC of 26%, 81% and 54% respectively; ritonavir Cmin decreased by 11% and Cmax and AUC increased by 71% and 49% respectively. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/200 mg) resulted in increases in amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC of 32%, 48% and 26%. The regimen where only fosamprenavir was increased (i.e. 1400/100 mg) achieved the highest plasma amprenavir exposure. In contrast, the regimen where both fosamprenavir and ritonavir were increased (i.e. 1400/200 mg) was associated with the highest incidence of ALT and AST elevations and is not recommended. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluation of high dose combinations of fosamprenavir and ritonavir (APV10028).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and ritonavir were assessed in healthy volunteers and it was found that amprenavir (450, 750 or 1200 mg twice daily) appeared to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (200 or 400 mg twice daily). Ritonavir improved the pharmacokinetic profile of amprenavir with all three regimens (400R/450A, 400R/750A, 200R/1200A) yielding higher AUC and Cmin than amprenavir alone (1200 mg twice daily).<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir and amprenavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>The effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir was studied in 14 HIV+ subjects receiving amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) and 15 HIV+ subjects receiving amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Cmin for amprenavir alone ranged from 20&#8211;3022 ng/ml and for amprenavir + ritonavir from 115&#8211;4848 ng/ml.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir were investigated in two groups of patients receiving amprenavir alone or with ritonavir (both with NNRTIs).

<p>The safety and pharmacokinetic kinetic interaction between amprenavir and ritonavir was studied in healthy volunteers. Amprenavir was dosed twice daily at 450 or 900 mg alone and with 100 or 300 mg ritonavir. Relative to amprenavir alone, ritonavir coadministration resulted in 3.3-4 fold increase in amprenavir AUC and a 10.8-14.2 fold increase in amprenavir Cmin.

<p><strong>Amprenavir + Efavirenz + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

<p>The timing of the amprenavir-efavirenz interaction and the effect of adding ritonavir were evaluated in seven HIV+ individuals receiving amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). In one patient efavirenz had no effect on amprenavir. The remaining individuals showed a decrease in amprenavir concentrations as early as day 7. The addition of low dose ritonavir reversed the effect of efavirenz on amprenavir concentrations.<br /><em>Efavirenz-induced decrease in plasma amprenavir levels in human immunodeficiency virus infected patients and correction by ritonavir.

From the pharmacokinetic data, it would appear that this may be a safe combination, but clinical monitoring should be used to ensure an adequate lipid lowering effect. Based on data with another boosted PI (lopinavir/ritonavir), a dose modification of rosuvastatin may be required. This is due to competition for uptake with the liver such that PLASMA concentrations of rosuvastatin may be increased but LIVER concentrations decreased, resulting in a decreased lipid lowering effect. Consider starting with the lowest possible dose and monitor for side effects due to increased plasma concentrations. Increase the dose as required, due to the potential impaired lipid response. </span>

<p>The effect of amprenavir on saquinavir is not well established. Coadministration of saquinavir (800 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) and amprenavir (750 or 800 mg three times daily for 2 weeks) to 7 subjects resulted in decreases in amprenavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 37%, 32% and 14% respectively. Saquinavir steady-state Cmax, AUC, and Cmin were increased 21%, decreased 19%, and decreased 48%, respectively, by concomitant amprenavir. Appropriate doses of the combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. The interaction between saquinavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir has not been evaluated. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of the soft gel formulation of saquinavir (800 mg three times daily) and amprenavir (800 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Saquinavir AUC was decreased by 18% and Cmax increased by 21% in the presence of amprenavir. There was a 36% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir, a 40% decrease in Cmax and no change in Cmin. As Cmin has been shown to be the best predictor for antiviral response, the efficacy of amprenavir should not be affected. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus protease inhibitors used in combination with amprenavir.

<p>Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) with saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) decreased saquinavir AUC and Cmax by 15% and 9%, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 18 HIV+ subjects. Saquinavir AUC decreased by 15% and there was no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of saquinavir (hard gel, 1000 mg twice daily) with fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) with ritonavir (100 or 200 mg twice daily) was investigated in 18 HIV+ patients. When fosamprenavir was added to the regimen containing 1000/100 mg saquinavir/ritonavir there was a 14, 9 and 24% decrease in saquinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively, although this was not statistically significant. When ritonavir dose was increased to 200 mg ritonavir this small and insignificant decrease was restored. This study also showed that the double boosted PI combination of saquinavir/ritonavir/fosamprenavir was well tolerated over the study period (22 days).<br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir/fosamprenavir in HIV-1-infected patients.

<p>Efavirenz (600 mg once daily) was administered for 10 days to 5 groups of 11 volunteers. On day 11 amprenavir (600 mg once daily) was added; on days 15-21 one group remained on efavirenz/amprenavir whereas a second PI (nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir or saquinavir) was added to each of the four remaining groups. Efavirenz concentrations were measured on days 14 and 21.

                    <span><p>Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5&#8209;fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite.

<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold. The AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite (5-hydroxy saxagliptin) decreased by 88% and 95% respectively when a single 100 mg dose of saxagliptin was coadministered with ketoconazole. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Fosamprenavir/ritonavir could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window.

Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

There have also been reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving higher dose antimonial therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, ECG monitoring is recommended before and during therapy with sodium stibogluconate. Where ECG monitoring is not available, the risks and benefits of sodium stibogluconate therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. Sodium stibogluconate should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias or other risk factors known to predispose towards QT prolongation: for example, those with congenital QTc prolongation or taking concomitant drugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval <br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August2007</em></p>
<div>Various case studies and trials of efficacy/tolerability of sodium stibogluconate describe Cardiotoxicity including QTc interval prolongation and occasionally torsades de pointes during, and occasionally after discontinuation of treatment.

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p><br />The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection.

<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

Subjects continued their randomized dose of fosamprenavir&#177;ritonavir for 14 more days (period 3), adding or removing tenofovir based upon its receipt in period 2. Plasma amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics were assessed on the last day of each period. Tenofovir Cmin, Cmax and AUC decreased by 12%, 25% and 15% after fosamprenavir coadministration and by 9%, 18% and 7% after fosamprenavir/ritonavir coadministration. Unboosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 3% and 7% after tenofovir coadministration; boosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 4% and 16% with tenofovir. No significant changes in ritonavir pharmacokinetics were observed. The authors conclude that the increases in amprenavir exposures and modest decreases in tenofovir exposures are unlikely to be clinically significant. <em>Steady-state amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics after coadministration of unboosted or ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in healthy volunteers.

<p>This study was a prospective phase I crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers who received fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 or 1400/200 mg once daily) with or without tenofovir (300 mg once daily) for 14 days. Tenofovir was added or discontinued (cross over) for another 14 days, with pharmacokinetics being assessed on days 14 and 28. There was no effect of tenofovir on amprenavir AUC or Cmax in either regimen. Tenofovir led to significant increases in ritonavir AUC (32%) and Cmax (71%) when given with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg. However, the authors conclude that no dose modification is necessary when combining fosamprenavir/ritonavir with tenofovir. <br /><em>Fosamprenavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics: no effect of tenofovir.

<p>The interaction between TDF (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg once daily) was investigated in healthy male subjects. The 24 h PK profiles for APV were similar for the two groups. There was no effect of TDF on APV AUC in either the 100 mg (GMR=0.99) or 200 mg (GMR=1.06) RTV groups. APV Cmax was unaffected by TDF in the 100 mg group (GMR=1.04), whereas the 200 mg group showed a non-significant increase (GMR=1.11). APV Ctrough showed non-significant increases in both groups (100 mg GMR=1.24, 200 mg GMR=1.02). There was a non-significant trend to higher RTV AUC in the 200 mg group. TDF monophosphate AUC and Cmax showed a non-significant trend to being lower in the 200 mg group, but with a higher Ctrough. Coadministration of TDF with FPV/RTV was generally well tolerated and the absence of relevant interactions suggests that no dose modification is necessary. <br /><em>Coadministration of tenofovir 300 mg once daily with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg once daily or 1400/200 mg once daily does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics.

<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of the FPV/RTV-TDF interaction in HIV+ patients (n=21) receiving FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily) in combination with TDF (300 mg once daily). Median (range) trough concentrations were 1586 (867-2925) ng/ml for APV, 166 (30-615) ng/ml for RTV and 64 (31-226) ng/ml for TDF. Trough concentrations were in the adequate ranges and no clinically relevant PK interaction was found.<br /><em>Plasma concentrations of amprenavir, ritonavir and tenofovir in HIV-infected patients treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg BID) and tenofovir (300 mg QD) containing regimen.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. The isoenzymes involved in thiopental metabolism have not been identified. Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for fosamprenavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range. </span>

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al. Timolol metabolism in human liver microsomes is mediated principally by CYP2D6. Drug Metab Dispos. 2007 Jul;35(7):1135-41.</em></p>
<p>Fosamprenavir with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism, e.g. flecainide and propafenone. When fosamprenavir and ritonavir are co-administered, the ritonavir metabolic drug interaction profile may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 but to a lesser extent than CYP3A4. <br /><em>Telzir&#174; (Fosamprenavir) 700mg film-coated tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated June 2011</em></p>

Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased fosamprenavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As fosamprenavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<p><strong>Amprenavir + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>Coadministration of voriconazole with high dose ritonavir (400 mg and above twice daily) is contraindicated because ritonavir significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at this dose. Coadministration of voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole. The effect of the coadministration of oral voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) and high dose (400 mg) and low dose (100 mg) oral ritonavir was investigated in two separate studies in healthy volunteers. High doses of ritonavir decreased the steady state Cmax and AUC of oral voriconazole by an average of 66% and 82%. Low doses of ritonavir decreased the Cmax and AUC of voriconazole by an average of 24% and 39% respectively. Administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on mean Cmax and AUC of ritonavir in the high dose study, although a minor decrease in steady state Cmax and AUC of ritonavir with an average of 25% and 13% respectively was observed in the low dose ritonavir interaction study. One outlier subject with raised voriconazole levels was identified in each of the ritonavir interaction studies. <br /><em>Vfend Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, October 2008. </em></p>
<p>Coadministration of voriconazole with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily for 9 days) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUC of oral voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 days) by an average of 24% and 39%, respectively. Repeat oral administration of voriconazole decreased steady state Cmax and AUC of low-dose ritonavir slightly by 24% and 14% respectively, when administered concomitantly with oral voriconazole in healthy subjects. <br /><em>Vfend Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>
