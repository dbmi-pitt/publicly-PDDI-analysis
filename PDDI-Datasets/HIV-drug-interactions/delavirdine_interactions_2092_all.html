                    <span><p>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<div>&nbsp;</div>There is a case report of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure probably related to the interaction of atorvastatin and delavirdine. A 63 year old male had well controlled hypercholesterolaemia for which he been receiving atorvastatin (20 mg daily) for 5 years and HIV infection for which he had been receiving indinavir, lamivudine and stavudine. About 2 months earlier, indinavir was substituted with delavirdine (400 mg three times daily). Approximately 1 month after starting delavirdine he developed a generalised malaise with muscle pain in legs and lower back, nausea, vomiting and dark urine. Laboratory investigations revealed acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. All medications were withheld and enzyme levels improved after 10 days and were normal 1 month later.<br /><em>Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure probably related to the interaction of atorvastatin and delavirdine.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction when atropine is used either systemically or as eye drops. Although metabolism of atropine is not fully elucidated, up to 50% is excreted unchanged via the kidneys. There is therefore little potential for clinically significant interactions with delavirdine via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                    <span>Benznidazole is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral doses (&gt; 90% bioavailability) and is widely distributed throughout the body. More than 40% of the drug is bound to plasma protein. The peak plasma concentration occurs after 3 to 4 hours and the half-life is about 12 hours. It is metabolised in the liver and more than 70% of the metabolites are excreted by the kidneys; about 30% of a dose is excreted in the faeces.<br /><em>Raaflaub J, Ziegler WH.

About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001).

In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer.

                    <span><p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene. Ghobadi C, Gregory A, Crewe HK, Rostami-Hodjegan A, Lennard MS. Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 2008;23(2):101-5.</em></p>
<p>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but an interaction has been predicted based on metabolism, clearance, and/or available in vitro data. Clomipramine is metabolized by CYP3A4, 1A2 and 2C19 to desmethylclomipramine, an active metabolite which has a higher activity than the parent drug. In addition, clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine are metabolized by CYP2D6. Delavirdine could potentially increase clomipramine but also desmethylclomipramine exposure.

His home medications included darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, isoniazid, pyridoxine, clopidogrel, aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, valsartan, sertraline, tamsulosin and esomeprazole. Potential drug-drug interactions between isoniazid and clopidogrel, and ritonavir and clopidogrel were identified that could interfere with clopidogrel activation. Based on this, platelet function testing was completed and impaired clopidogrel response was seen on two platelet function tests.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism of vitamin D to active metabolites occurs in the liver and kidneys, and is thought to involve CYP3A4 and CYP24A1. In vitro studies have shown rifampicin (an enzyme inducer) increased metabolism of vitamin D and introduction of 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor in grapefruit juice) reversed the effects of rifampicin on vitamin D clearance. As an inhibitor of CYP3A, delavirdine is not expected to reduce the effect of vitamin D, but the consequence of CYP3A inhibition on the clinical effect of vitamin D is not known. However, no effect of antiretroviral therapy on the response to vitamin D supplementation was found in a PK modelling study.</span>

                    <span><p>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></p>
<p>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em></p>
<p>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Coadministration of ddI buffered tablets (125 or 250 mg twice daily for 28 days) and delavirdine (400 mg three times daily for 28 days) to 9 individuals resulted decreases in ddI Cmax and AUC of 20% and 21% when compared to data obtained when delavirdine and didanosine were dosed 1 h apart. There was in a 32% decrease in delavirdine Cmax, a 19% decrease in AUC and no change in Cmin.

<div>&nbsp;</div>A study in 12 HIV+ individuals who received delavirdine (400 mg) and didanosine (125&#8211;250 mg every 12 h) found that ddI AUC (0-infinity) was reduced by concurrent delavirdine (7.93 &#177; 3.9 vs 6.54 &#177; 2.3 &#181;M.h; alone vs concurrent). Separating the doses by 1 h overcame this reduction (AUC 1 h apart = 7.94 &#177; 4.8 &#181;M.h). Cmax was reduced by concurrent delavirdine (4.65 &#177; 2 vs 3.22 &#177; 0.59 &#181;M; alone vs concurrent) and again separating the doses by 1 h overcame this reduction (Cmax 1 h apart = 4.63 &#177; 1.3 &#181;M).

                    <span>Diethylcarbamazine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and also through the skin and conjunctiva. It is widely distributed in tissues and is mainly excreted in the urine unchanged and as the N-oxide metabolite. Urinary excretion and hence plasma half-life is dependent on urinary pH. About 5% of a dose is eliminated in the faeces. Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

Emtricitabine did not inhibit the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation (uridine-5&#8217;-disphosphoglucuronyl transferase). Based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathways of emtricitabine, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low. <br /><em>Emtriva Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, November 2011.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin of 22%, 24% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects resulted in increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively, with no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p></span>

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

<p>Delavirdine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), but in vitro data suggest that delavirdine may also be metabolized by CYP2D6. The major metabolic pathways for delavirdine are N-desalkylation and pyridine hydroxylation. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that delavirdine reduces CYP3A activity and inhibits its own metabolism. In vitro studies have also shown that delavirdine reduces CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 activity.<br /><em>Rescriptor&#174; (Delavirdine) US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated May 2008</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Delavirdine is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but could potentially increase the amount of morphine entering the CNS due to inhibition of P-gp and thus potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS.

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of delavirdine via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as delavirdine may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification. CYP3A4 metabolism of (S)-ifosfamide may generate a neurotoxic metabolite. <br /><em>Granvil CP, Madan A, Sharkawi M, et al. Drug Metab Dispos1999; 27: 533-41; Roy P, Tretyakov O, Wright J, et al.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased. Ketoconazole may decrease the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.<br /><em>Kerbusch T, et al. Modulation of the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of ifosfamide by ketoconazole and rifampin.

There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean Cmax and AUC of imatinib rose by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering imatinib with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering Imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. Imatinib may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs.<br /><em>Glivec Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, October 2012.</em></p>
<p>There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40% respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib was co-administered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. Imatinib increases the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.<br /><em>Gleevec Prescribing Information, Novartis, January 2013.</em></p>
<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable.

<p>When compared to indinavir 800 mg three times daily, coadministration of delavirdine (400 mg three times daily) and indinavir (600 mg three times daily) increased indinavir AUC by 53% and Cmin by 298%.

<p>Delavirdine inhibits the metabolism of indinavir such that coadministration of 400-mg or 600-mg indinavir three times daily with 400-mg delavirdine three times daily alters indinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin. Coadministration of delavirdine (400 mg three time daily) and indinavir (400 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 28 subjects resulted in a 36% decrease in indinavir Cmax, no change in AUC and a ~2-fold increase in Cmin (when compared to indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone). Coadministration of delavirdine (400 mg three time daily) and indinavir (600 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 28 subjects resulted in no change in indinavir Cmax, a 53% increase in AUC and a ~4-fold increase in Cmin (when compared to indinavir 800 mg three times daily alone). Indinavir had no effect on delavirdine pharmacokinetics based on a comparison to historical delavirdine pharmacokinetic data. Dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking delavirdine 400 mg three times a day. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>The effect of a single dose of indinavir (400 or 600 mg) on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine (400 mg three times daily) was investigated in 14 healthy volunteers. Mean indinavir AUC (0-infinity) for 400 mg with delavirdine was only 14% lower than that obtained following 800 mg indinavir alone (29600 &#177; 7920 vs 25400 &#177; 6960 nM.h; 800 mg alone vs 400 mg with delavirdine). A 600 mg dose with delavirdine produced indinavir AUC (0-infinity) which were 44% greater than for 800 mg alone (29600 &#177; 7920 vs 42700 &#177; 9800 nM.h; 800 mg alone vs 600 mg with delavirdine). Delavirdine decreased indinavir Cmax (13200 &#177; 2590 vs 7560 &#177; 1160 nM; 800 mg alone vs 400 mg with delavirdine). Trough indinavir concentrations were increased in the presence of delavirdine (245 &#177; 212 vs 596 &#177; 380 nM; 800 mg alone vs 400 mg with delavirdine). Results indicated that single doses of indinavir had no clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine. Delavirdine has minimal effect on indinavir absorption, but decreases the oral clearance resulting in higher trough concentrations. Results support the possibility of a reduction in indinavir dosage or frequency of administration when given in combination with delavirdine. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions study of delavirdine and indinavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

<p>The effect of switching from nevirapine or efavirenz to delavirdine or adding delavirdine was evaluated in a clinical setting in 15 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (with or without other PIs). In 8 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir, the presence of delavirdine increased the AUC of lopinavir by 33% (7-134%). The tolerability of delavirdine containing regimens was a frequent problem resulting in drug discontinuation in 5/15 patients. <br /><em>Delavirdine effects on exposure to ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors.

<p>
<p>The effect of delavirdine (600 mg bd) on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 or 266/66 mg bd) was studied in 26 healthy volunteers. When compared to the standard dose of lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg alone, the addition of delavirdine resulted in increases in lopinavir Cmin, AUC and Cmax of 53%, 24% and 13%. The lower dose of lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in reduced lopinavir exposure by ~25% when compared to the standard dose alone. Ritonavir exposure was increased by ~50% in the presence of delavirdine. Delavirdine exposure was decreased by ~25-30%. In the presence of delavirdine, the lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg regimen was not as well tolerated as the 266/66 mg regimen. Further clinical studies are needed to determine if optimal safety and efficacy are achieved with reduced dose or full dose lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with delavirdine. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between delavirdine, lopinavir and ritonavir during coadministration in healthy volunteers.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs there is little potential for interaction. Mannitol is metabolised only very slightly, if at all, to glycogen in the liver; it is predominantly eliminated unchanged via glomerular filtration. There is little potential for mannitol to affect the disposition of antiretrovirals, or to be altered if co-administered with antiretrovirals.</span>

                    <span>Mannitol is metabolized only very slightly, if at all, to glycogen in the liver. The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

Plasma concentrations of its major metabolites (amino and hydroxylated amino forms of mebendazole) are substantially higher than those of mebendazole. Impaired hepatic function, impaired metabolism, or impaired biliary elimination may lead to higher plasma levels of mebendazole. <br />Mebendazole, the conjugated forms of mebendazole, and its metabolites likely undergo some degree of enterohepatic recirculation and are excreted in the urine and bile. The apparent elimination half-life after an oral dose ranges from 3 to 6 hours in most patients.<br /><em>Ovex&#174; Summary of Product Characteristics, McNeil Products Ltd.

<p>In 8 patients, the [14C]-aminopyrine breath test (ABT) and maximum serum concentration of mebendazole following a dose of 1.5 g of mebendazole three times daily were determined before and after treatment with cimetidine (400mg three times daily for 30 days). Serum mebendazole concentrations were measured in blood samples taken 2 h after each drug intake. Cimetidine lowered the 14CO2 specific activity (SA) at 1 h and increased the maximum serum concentration of mebendazole (82.3ng/ml vs 55.7ng/ml). <br /><em>Cimetidine increases serum mebendazole concentrations.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

Approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and mesna disulphide respectively.<br /><em>Mesna Tablets/Injection US Prescribing Information, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, updated February 2009</em></span>

<p>Coadministration of delavirdine (600 mg twice daily for 7 days) and methadone (mean maintenance dose 71 mg) was studied in 15 HIV-negative subjects stable on methadone maintenance; a further 15 subjects acted as delavirdine control subjects (non-opioid maintained). Delavirdine significantly decreased methadone clearance and increased half life, resulting in increases in AUC (19%), Cmax (8%) and Cmin (29%). When compared to values obtained in the control subjects, methadone had no effect on delavirdine concentrations (AUC24h 385.1 &#181;M.h vs 395.8 &#181;M.h, control vs methadone). Delavirdine should be used with caution in opioid-maintained patients; the coadministration will require close clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms opioid toxicity. <br /><em>Drug interactions between opioids and antiretroviral medications: interaction between methadone, LAAM, and delavirdine.

<p>The effect of methadone on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine (600 mg bd) was assessed in 16 non-HIV+ volunteers who were maintained on methadone (40-120 mg per day). Results were compared to delavirdine pharmacokinetic values obtained following administration of delavirdine (600 mg bd) to 15 non-opiod dependent control subjects. Methadone coadminitration did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine (Cmax 41 vs 32.6 &#181;M, control vs +methadone; AUC 290 vs 236 &#181;M.h, control vs +methadone). However, delavirdine metabolism demonstrated large interpatient variability and appeared to be circadian in nature. <br /><em>Lack of effect of methadone on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine and n-delavirdine.

<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). Delavirdine does not induce UGT and therefore is unlikely to alter morphine concentrations. However, delavirdine inhibits P-gp and could potentially increase the amount of morphine entering the CNS and thus potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS. Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

                    <span><p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily for 14 days) and delavirdine (400 mg three times daily for 7 days) to 12 individuals resulted in an 88% increase in nelfinavir Cmax, a 107% increase in AUC and a 136% increase in Cmin. Plasma concentrations of an active metabolite of nelfinavir (M8) were significantly reduced by delavirdine, but this was more than compensated for by the increase in nelfinavir concentrations. Delavirdine pharmacokinetics were reduced by 27% for Cmax, 31% for AUC and 33% for Cmin.

<p>Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) with delavirdine (400 mg every 8 h for 14 days), in 7 subjects caused decreases of 31%, 27% and 33% in delavirdine AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 hours for 14 days) with delavirdine (400 mg every 8 h for 7 days), in 12 subjects caused increases of 107%, 88% and 136% in nelfinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively.

<p>Delavirdine (400 mg three times daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) were coadministered to 24 healthy volunteers. Delavirdine increased nelfinavir AUC from 26 &#177; 11 to 50 &#177; 11 &#181;g.h/ml and the AUC of active metabolite was decreased from 9 &#177; 2 to 5 &#177; 2 &#181;g.h/ml. Half-life of nelfinavir was increased from 3.1 &#177; 0.6 to 6.3 &#177; 1.2 h. Delavirdine inhibits the metabolic clearance of nelfinavir. Nelfinavir decreased delavirdine AUC from 210 &#177; 112 to 122 &#177; 24 &#181;M and decreased Cmin from 21 &#177; 13 to 10 &#177; 3 &#181;M.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Neostigmine is thought to undergo a degree of hepatic metabolism, although the mechanisms are unknown. However, as metabolism also occurs via hydrolysis by cholinesterase and up to 50% of a dose is excreted unchanged via the kidneys, there is little potential for clinically significant interaction with antiretrovirals via liver enzyme modification.</span>

                    <span><p>Neostigmine undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterase and is also metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on limited data concerning metabolism, elimination and toxicity of nifurtimox, there is little potential  for interaction, although due to the lack of data, vigilance is required if administering nifurtimox with antiretrovirals.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

<p>Case reports have been presented on four patients receiving delavirdine with proton pump inhibitors (one omeprazole, one rabeprazole, two lansoprazole). Delavirdine concentrations were low in both patients on omeprazole and rabeprazole and in one of the patients on lansoprazole. This study is very limited due to the small number of participants, but caution is advised when using delavirdine and proton pump inhibitors together.<br /><em>The effect of gastric proton pump inhibitors on delavirdine absorption: Four case reports.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines. If coadministration is considered necessary, monitor antiretroviral drug levels.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction.

                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction when pilocarpine is used either orally or as eye drops. Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and serum esterases, there is therefore little potential for interaction with delavirdine via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Since proguanil is a prodrug, there is concern that inhibition of CYP3A4 by delavirdine will reduce the pharmacological effect. However, synergy with atovaquone is related to proguanil, not cycloguanil. When the drugs are coadministered, CYP inhibition could potentially enhance this synergistic effect which may offset decreased cycloguanil formation.</span>

                    <span>Pyridostigmine bromide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterases and is also metabolised in the liver. Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<div>Case reports have been presented on four patients receiving delavirdine with proton pump inhibitors (one omeprazole, one rabeprazole, two lansoprazole). Delavirdine concentrations were low in both patients on omeprazole and rabeprazole and in one of the patients on lansoprazole. This study is very limited due to the small number of participants, but caution is advised when using delavirdine and proton pump inhibitors together.<br />The effect of gastric proton pump inhibitors on delavirdine absorption: Four case reports.

                      <span>Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. A clinical study demonstrated that ritonavir, saquinavir, delavirdine and nelfinavir increased activity of retinal dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis.

                    <span><p>Vitamin A substances are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but absorption may be reduced in the presence of fat malabsorption, low protein intake, or impaired liver or pancreatic function. Vitamin A esters are hydrolysed by pancreatic enzymes to retinol, which is then absorbed and re-esterified. Some retinol is stored in the liver. It is released from the liver bound to a specific &#945;1-globulin (retinol-binding protein) in the blood. The retinol not stored in the liver undergoes glucuronide conjugation and subsequent oxidation to retinal and retinoic acid; these and other metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body.

<p>Coadministration of delavirdine (400 mg three times daily) and rifabutin (300 mg once daily) to six HIV+ individuals showed that delavirdine increased rifabutin AUC from 2.6 &#177; 0.6 to 8.9 &#177; 3.3 &#181;g.h/ml and increased rifabutin Cmin from 29 &#177; 6 to 161 &#177; 54 ng/ml. Delavirdine inhibits rifabutin clearance and produces a 200% increase in rifabutin exposure.

<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (600 mg every 12 hours) and delavirdine (400 mg every 8 hours) was investigated in 12 HIV+ patients. Delavirdine caused a statistically significant increase in ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin, with AUC increasing by 50-80%.

<p>When studied in healthy volunteers (n=7), ritonavir 100 mg bd had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of delavirdine (600 mg bd).

Concomitant use of systemic ketoconazole significantly increases systemic exposure to salmeterol. This may lead to an increase in the incidence of systemic effects (e.g. prolongation in the QTc interval and palpitations). Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once daily) and salmeterol (50 mcg inhaled twice daily) in 15 healthy subjects for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure (1.4-fold Cmax and 15-fold AUC). Clinically significant effects were not seen on blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose and blood potassium levels. Co-administration with ketoconazole did not increase the elimination half-life of salmeterol or increase salmeterol accumulation with repeat dosing. There is likely to be a similar risk of interaction with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, ritonavir). <br /><em>Serevent (salmeterol) Summary of Product Characteristics, Allen &amp; Hanburys, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Due to the potential increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events, the concomitant use of salmeterol with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) is not recommended. In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction study in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76; 90% CI: 10.66, 23.31) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta agonist&#8211;mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. <br /><em>Serevent (salmeterol) Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, March 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5&#8209;fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.<br /><em>Onglyza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol Myers Squibb &#8211; Astra Zeneca, December 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold. The AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite (5-hydroxy saxagliptin) decreased by 88% and 95% respectively when a single 100 mg dose of saxagliptin was coadministered with ketoconazole. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). The dose of saxagliptin is 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors.<br /><em>Onglyza US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, December 2011.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Coadministration is contraindicated with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir. Co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg twice daily) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 1,000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours, the plasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/ml, compared to approximately 5 ng/ml when sildenafil was administered alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg three times a day) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. A downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered when sildenafil is coadministered to patients already receiving medium potency CYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin or saquinavir. A downward dose adjustment to 20 mg once daily is recommended in case of coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors of intermediate potency like clarithromycin, telithromycin and nefazodone. <br /><em>Revatio (sildenafil) Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, December 2009</em></p>
<p>The concomitant administration of the protease inhibitor ritonavir (a highly potent CYP3A inhibitor) substantially increases serum concentrations of sildenafil; therefore, co-administration of ritonavir or other potent CYP3A inhibitors with Revatio is not recommended. In study in healthy volunteers, co-administration with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg BID) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours, the plasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when sildenafil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors (except saquinavir) and Revatio has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase sildenafil levels. In a study performed in healthy volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg TID) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. <br /><em>Revatio Prescribing Information, Pfizer Labs, November 2009.</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Delavirdine could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window. The European SPC warns that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD but this has not been assessed in a clinical study.</span>

In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD.

Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole blood antimony levels to approximately 1 to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an intravenous dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of sodium stibogluconate into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days<br /><em>Pentostam&#174; (sodium stibogluconate) injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, updated August 2007</em></p>
<p>The renal excretion of sodium stibogluconate was studied in patients with kala azar and in volunteers; both urine and serum levels of sodium stibogluconate were measured. After intravenous injection sodium stibogluconate seemed to be distributed throughout the extracellular fluid and to have a renal clearance similar to that of inulin. After intramuscular injection, peak blood levels were lower and more sustained. However, more than 80% was excreted in the first 6 h, and blood levels fell to around 1% of peak values in 16 h. The dangers of cumulative toxicity may be exaggerated, and restriction of courses of sodium stibogluconate to 30 days or even to 10 days may not be necessary. <br /><em>Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate was examined in 29 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis following intramuscular administration of sodium stibogluconate equivalent to 600mg of antimony (Sb). The blood concentration-time data conformed to the one-compartment open model with mean and (SEM) of the apparent first-order rate constants for absorption (ka) and elimination (kd) of 1.71 (0.15) and 0.391 (0.016) hr-1, respectively. The total body clearance (TBC) and the volume of distribution (Vd) were 17.67 (1.38) L/hr and 45.7 (2.6) L, respectively, assuming a complete absorption. The fraction of dose of Sb excreted in the urine was 0.80 (0.07) and the renal clearance was 12.7 (1.16) L/hr. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of antimony in patients treated with sodium stibogluconate for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

It penetrates into the CSF within 4 hours of an oral dose to produce therapeutic concentrations, which may be more than half those in the blood. Up to 40% of sulfadiazine in the blood is present as the acetyl derivative. About 50% of a single dose of sulfadiazine given orally is excreted in the urine in 24 hours; 15 to 40% is excreted as the acetyl derivative. The urinary excretion of sulfadiazine and the acetyl derivative is dependent on pH. About 30% is excreted unchanged in both fast and slow acetylators when the urine is acidic whereas about 75% is excreted unchanged by slow acetylators when the urine is alkaline.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<div>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br />Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism. Winter HR, Unadkat JD. Drug Metab Dispos. 2005 Jul;33(7):969-76.<br /><br />In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that delavirdine reduces CYP3A activity and inhibits its own metabolism. In vitro studies have also shown that delavirdine reduces CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 activity.<br /><em>Rescriptor&#174; (delavirdine mesylate) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, revised May 2008</em></div>

<div>The capacity of clinically available nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to inhibit the activity of human cytochromes P450 (CYPs) was studied in vitro using human liver microsomes. Hydroxylation of tolbutamide (CYP2C9) or S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19) were importantly inhibited by delavirdine and efavirenz. This indicates the likelihood of significantly impaired clearance of CYP2C substrate drugs (such as phenytoin, tolbutamide, and warfarin) upon initial exposure to these two NNRTIs. <br /><em>Inhibition of human cytochrome P450 isoforms by nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. von Moltke LL, Greenblatt DJ, Granda BW et al.

                    <span><p><br />Around 90% of a dose reaches the colon where bacteria split the drug into sulfapyridine (SP) and mesalazine (ME). These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours. Renal clearance constant was 125ml/min corresponding to the GFR.<br /><em>Salazopyrin En-Tabs&#174; (Sulfasalazine) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Limited, updated August 2010</em></p>
<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection.

Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. The isoenzymes involved in thiopental metabolism have not been identified. Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for delavirdine to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition.

                    <span><p><br />Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al. Timolol metabolism in human liver microsomes is mediated principally by CYP2D6. Drug Metab Dispos. 2007 Jul;35(7):1135-41.</em></p>
<p>In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that delavirdine reduces CYP3A activity and inhibits its own metabolism.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Topotecan undergoes both hepatic and renal elimination. Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. In vitro data have shown delavirdine is an inhibitor of both P-gp and BCRP and thus could potentially increase topotecan exposure and increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased delavirdine plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As delavirdine is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on limited data concerning the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profile of vercuronium, there is little potential for interaction with delavirdine via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>
