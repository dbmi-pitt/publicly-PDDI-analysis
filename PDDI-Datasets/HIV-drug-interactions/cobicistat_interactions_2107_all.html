Beclometasone is a pro-drug which is not metabolised by CYP450, but is hydrolysed via esterase enzymes to the highly active metabolite beclometasone -17-monopropionate. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased the AUC and Cmax of beclomethasone-17-monoproprionate by 108% and 67%, respectively. A similar pharmacokinetic effect could potentially occur with the coadministration of cobicistat. However, although statistically significant, the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir did not affect the adrenal function. Use the lowest possible corticosteroid dose with caution and monitor for corticosteroid side effects.</span>

The European SPC does not recommended coadministration as it may lead to decreased cobicistat concentrations and consequently those of atazanavir and darunavir being boosted, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance. However, the US Prescribing Information suggests the following dose modifications. For patients stable on cobicistat, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability. When starting cobicistat in patients stable on bosentan, discontinue bosentan at least 36 h prior to starting cobicistat and resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability.

A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclometasone).

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclophosphamide is metabolized by two pathways. Activation (major pathway) to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is catalyzed by CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9 and 3A4. Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. In theory, cobicistat could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway which may increase the efficacy and the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Careful monitoring of cyclophosphamide related side effects is recommended.</span>

Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration is predicted to increase the conversion to active metabolite etonogestrel due to inhibition of CYP3A4. Since no data are available to make recommendations on the use of atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat with combined or progestogen-only oral or implanted contraceptives, alternative forms of contraception should be used.</span>

Similarly, coadministration with cobicistat could potentially increase etonogestrel exposure.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin but cobicistat is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). Cobicistat does not induce UGT and is unlikely to alter morphine concentrations. However, cobicistat does inhibit P-gp and could potentially increase the amount of morphine entering the CNS and may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS. Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

SN38 is further inactivated by several UGTs. Cobicistat could potentially increase the amount of parent drug available for conversion to SN38 and thus increase the risk of irinotecan related toxicity. Close monitoring of irinotecan induced toxicity is recommended. Note, the US Prescribing Information contraindicates the use of irinotecan with atazanavir/cobicistat (but not darunavir/cobicistat) due to inhibition of UGT1A1 by atazanavir.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Norelgestromin is metabolized to norgestrel (possibly by CYP3A4). A study of transdermally delivered ethinylestradiol and norelgestromin in HIV-infected women on stable lopinavir/ritonavir showed lopinavir/ritonavir decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 45% but increased norelgestromin AUC by 83% compared to a control group not on cART. Similarly, cobicistat could potentially increase norelgestromin exposure. Contrary to ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP2C9 and glucuronidation therefore cobicistat is predicted to increase ethinylestradiol concentrations. Since no data are available to make recommendations on the use of atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat with combined or progestogen-only oral or implanted contraceptives, alternative forms of contraception should be used.</span>

Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines.

Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4. Since proguanil is a prodrug, there is concern that inhibition of metabolism by cobicistat will reduce the pharmacological effect. However, synergy with atovaquone is related to proguanil, not cycloguanil. When the drugs are coadministered, CYP inhibition could potentially enhance this synergistic effect which may offset decreased cycloguanil formation.</span>

Coadministration with cobicistat either alone or with atazanavir or darunavir has not been studied. Coadministration of elvitegravir/cobicistat (150/150 mg once daily) and rifabutin (150 mg every other day) decreased cobicistat Cmin by 66%, but had no effect on AUC or Cmax. Rifabutin exposure was similar to values obtained alone, but 25-O-desacetylrifabutin AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 525%, 384% and 394%, respectively. The European SPC recommends that if the combination is needed, to use rifabutin 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (e.g. Monday-Wednesday-Friday) and the US Prescribing Information recommends 150 mg every other day. Increased monitoring for rifabutin associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis due to increased desacetyl rifabutin exposure is recommended. Further dose reduction of rifabutin has not been studied and a twice weekly dose of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated in urine as unchanged drug (active secretion by OAT3, OATP4C1, P-gp) and metabolism by CYP3A4 represents a minor elimination pathway. Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Cobicistat could potentially increase sitagliptin concentrations. However, this increase may not be clinically significant as the drug is mainly eliminated unchanged and has a large safety window. The European SPC warns that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors could alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD but this has not been assessed in clinical study.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYPs 3A4 and 2D6 may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. </span>

Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for cobicistat to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range.</span>

Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Coadministration could potentially increase ziprasidone concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4. Monitor side effects and decrease dosage if needed. Of note, the effect of ziprasidone on QT interval was not increased in presence of a metabolic inhibitor. Thus, the risk of QT interval prolongation is not increased in presence of CYPs inhibitors that do not prolong the QT interval.</span>
