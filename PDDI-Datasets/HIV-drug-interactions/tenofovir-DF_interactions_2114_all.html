<p>Triple NRTI Therapy:<br />There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. <br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and abacavir (300 mg single dose) was studied in 8 HIV-negative subjects. There was no change in tenofovir AUC or Cmax; abacavir AUC was unaltered and Cmax increased by 12%. <br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>The plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and abacavir, lamivudine or lopinavir was investigated in HIV+ subjects receiving TDF + 3TC/LPV (n=7), TDF + 3TC/NVP (n=8), TDF + ABC/LPV (n=7) or TDF + ABC/NVP (n=5). Between group comparisons showed no significant interaction between tenofovir and abacavir or lamivudine. <br /><em>A pharmacokinetic study in HIV infected patients under tenofovir fumarate: investigation of systemic and intracellular interaction between TDF and abacavir, or lamivudine or lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>The effect of stopping tenofovir on the intracellular pharmacokinetics of abacavir was studied in 8 HIV-infected subjects initially receiving abacavir and tenofovir with lamivudine or stavudine.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion with ~20-40% of an oral dose and ~60-80% of a parenteral dose being excreted in the urine in 6 hours. As tenofovir-DF is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. There is little potential for a significant interaction with orally administered ampicillin.</span>

Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 22%, 16% and 23%, respectively. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively. The efficacy of atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir in treatment-experienced patients has been demonstrated in clinical study 045 and in treatment naive patients in clinical study 138. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, if tenofovir is  needed, a dose increase to atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg with  TDM may be considered.

Tenofovir may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. When coadministered with tenofovir in adults, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir 300 mg (all as a single daily dose with food). Increase atazanavir/ritonavir to 400/100 mg once daily in treatment-experienced patients receiving both tenofovir and a H2-receptor antagonist. For treatment-experienced pregnant patients during the second or third trimester receiving tenofovir, increase atazanavir/ritonavir to 400/100 mg once daily. There are insufficient data to recommend an atazanavir dose for use with both an H2-receptor antagonist and tenofovir in treatment-experienced pregnant women. Atazanavir increases tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including renal disorders. Patients receiving atazanavir and tenofovir should be monitored for tenofovir- associated adverse reactions. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with tenofovir (300 mg once daily), in 34 subjects, caused a 21%, 25% and 40% decrease in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively; tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 14%, 24% and 22%, respectively. When atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was coadministered with tenofovir (300 mg once daily), in 10 subjects, decreases of 28%, 25% and 23% in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively, were observed (compared to atazanavir/ritonavir without tenofovir). The geometric mean values for atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, when coadministered with ritonavir and tenofovir, were 3190 ng/ml, 34459 ng.h/ml and 491 ng/ml, respectively. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em><br /></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Coadministration of atazanvir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC (25%), Cmax (28%) and Cmin (26%).

<p>Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) to 33 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax (14%), AUC (24%) and Cmin (22%). Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 21%, 25% and 40% respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 42 days) increased tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 34%, 37% and 29%, respectively; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 28%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, addition of tenofovir-DF to atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, resulted in AUC and Cmin values of atazanavir that were 2.3- and 4-fold higher than the respective values observed for atazanavir 400 mg when given alone. When coadministered with tenofovir-DF, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Tenofovir-DF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Patients receiving tenofovir-DF concomitantly with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir-DF should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. <br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>Atazanavir trough concentrations were determined in 43 HIV+ subjects receiving unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) in the presence of tenofovir-DF. The median trough concentration was 242 (range 106-1100) ng/ml with 8 subjects having low trough concentrations (&lt;150 ng/ml). Following a dose increase to 600 mg once daily in 4/8 subjects, atazanavir trough concentrations were 222-294 ng/ml. Viral load results were available for 36 subjects, 31 of whom were undetectable (&lt;50 copies/ml) at baseline. 30 remained &lt;50 copies/ml and all were &lt;100 copies/ml at last follow up. Five subjects had viral loads &gt;50 copies/ml at baseline, of whom 3 were undetectable at last follow up. <br /><em>Atazanavir trough levels in patients receiving unboosted atazanavir and tenofovir.

<p>The pharmacokinetic effects of the coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and unboosted atazanavir was studied in HIV-negative subjects. A dosing strategy that would provide atazanavir and tenofovir exposures comparable to each drug when dosed alone was evaluated. The strategies employed were dosing the ATV (400 mg once daily) and TDF 12 hours apart and increasing the ATV dose to 600 mg once daily. The temporal 12 hour separation of ATV 400 mg resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC, Cmin of 10%, 17%, and 28%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 43%, 37%, and 38%, respectively. The simultaneous administration of 600 mg ATV with TDF resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 27%, 36%, and 41%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 41%, 59%, and 74%, respectively. Based on these findings the authors continue to recommend that when co-dosed with TDF, ATV (300 mg once daily) should be combined with RTV (100 mg once daily). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala S, et al. 3rd IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, Rio de Janiero, July 2005, abstract WePe3.3C07. </em></p>
<p>A study was performed in healthy volunteers to determine whether increasing ATV/RTV from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg once daily with TDF, or maintaining the standard dose but separating administration of TDF by 12 h, could overcome the 25% decrease in ATV exposure previously seen when coadministered with TDF. Relative to ATV/RTV 300/100, simultaneous administration of ATV/RTV 400/100 resulted in increases in ATV AUC and Cmin of 38% and 33% respectively. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 55% and 70% respectively. Maintaining the standard dose, but separating administration by 12 h, resulted in an 11% decrease in ATV AUC and a 20% decrease in Cmin. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 37% and 29% respectively. RTV exposure was comparable across treatments. Due to the increases in ATV and higher TDF exposures, coadministration of ATV/RTV 400/100 mg with TDF is not recommended. Separation of ATV/RTV 300/100 mg and TDF doses is not expected to offer any additional clinical advantage over simultaneous administration. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 16.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of TDF (300 mg once daily) when given with ATV/RTV (300/100 mg once daily) were assessed in a substudy of the Puzzle2-ANRS 107 trial. Full PK profiles were determined in 10 patients: median (range) TDF Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 234 (121-855) ng/ml, 45 (23-215) ng/ml and 2253 (1305-11285) ng/ml.h respectively. Trough concentrations at weeks 6, 10, 18 and 26 were 58, 64, 53 and 57 ng/ml respectively (n=32-38). Tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable to historical data obtained from healthy and HIV+ subjects, suggesting that tenofovir exposure is not substantially altered when coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir when combined with atazanavir /ritonavir in HIV infected patients with multiple treatment failures: a substudy of Puzzle2- ANRS 107 trial.

<p>Steady state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazananavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir-DF and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir-DF. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. <br /><em>Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) were investigated in 10 HIV+ patients. After the addition of tenofovir-DF, both atazanavir and ritonavir exposure were reduced. Atazanavir Cmax decreased from 5233 &#177; 3033 to 3443 &#177; 1412 ng/ml (mean &#177; sd), AUC decreased from 53761 &#177; 35255 to 39276 &#177; 23034 ng/ml.h, and Cmin decreased from 862 &#177; 838 to 577 &#177; 367 ng/ml. <br /><em>Interactions between atazanavir-ritonavir and tenofovir in heavily pretreated human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and/or ddI-EC were investigated in 36 healthy subjects. Addition of tenofovir-DF decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin (21%, 25% and 40% respectively); tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin were increased by 1.14-, 1.24- and 1.22-fold respectively in the presence of atazanavir. In the presence of tenofovir-DF and ddI-EC (250 mg once daily with food), atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 24%, 26% and 39% respectively (compared to atazanavir alone); tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased 1.12-, 1.25- and 1.25-fold respectively (compared to tenofovir alone). <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the combination of atazanavir, enteric coated didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for a once daily antiretroviral regimen.

If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is  co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored  adequately.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Tenofovir  DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic  agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs)). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose  or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk  factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some  patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy.  Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at  risk for renal dysfunction. Since tenofovir-DF is primarily eliminated  by the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce  renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase  serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of  other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not  limited to, cidofovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir,  valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or  multiple NSAIDs.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></div></span>

Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product). This renal transporter (hOAT1) may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of tenofovir, adefovir and cidofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products might be modified if they are co-administered. In healthy volunteers, a single dose of adefovir dipivoxil given with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in a relevant drug-drug interaction with regard to pharmacokinetics. However, the clinical safety including potential renal effects of the co-administration of adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is unknown. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal products is not recommended, but if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. <br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em></p>

                    <span><p>Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (at a dose lower than recommended or with a different dosing regimen) increased tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 22%, 24% and 37%, respectively. Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 21%, 16% and 24%, respectively. The increase in tenofovir is from an effect on MDR1 transport in renal tubules. Monitoring of renal function may be indicated when darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir is given in combination with tenofovir, particularly in patients with underlying systemic or renal disease, or in patients taking nephrotoxic agents. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, <em>June 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>The interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and tenofovir was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Darunavir and tenofovir exposure was increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 16%, 21% and 24%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 24%, 22% and 37%, respectively. Darunavir/ritonavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can be coadministered without any dose adjustments. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was administered with darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily), there was no sigificant effect on darunavir/ritonavir PK parameters. Tenofovir AUC increased by 22% and Cmin increased by 37%. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events, including renal disorders. A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of renal function is required in these patients. In patients with renal risk factors, the co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully evaluated.</p><div><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em></div><p>&nbsp;</p><div><div>Darunavir coadministered with ritonavir have been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations.

If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is   co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored   adequately.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Tenofovir   DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic   agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs   (NSAIDs)). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose   or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with  risk  factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF.  Some  patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy.   Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at   risk for renal dysfunction. Since tenofovir-DF is primarily eliminated   by the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce   renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase   serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of   other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not   limited to, cidofovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir,   valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or   multiple NSAIDs.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></div></span>

                      <span>Coadministration is not recommended due to increased didanosine concentrations and toxicity. If this combination is judged strictly necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for efficacy and didanosine related adverse events. The US Prescribing Informations for didanosine and tenofovir-DF recommend a reduced dose of didanosine (250 mg once daily for adults weighing 60 kg or greater with creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or greater; 200 mg once daily for adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or greater).

                    <span><p>Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine is not recommended. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse events. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. <br />Triple NRTI Therapy: <br />There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. <br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em></p>
<p><div>Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When administered with tenofovir-DF, Cmax and AUC of didanosine increased significantly. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir-DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. In patients weighing less than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 200 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. When coadministered, tenofovir-DF and didanosine EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). For additional information on coadministration of tenofovir-DF and didanosine, please refer to the full prescribing information for didanosine. When didanosine 250 mg enteric-coated capsules were administered with tenofovir-DF, systemic exposures of didanosine were similar to those seen with the 400 mg enteric-coated capsules alone under fasted conditions. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and buffered didanosine (250 or 400 mg once daily for 7 days, n=14) had no effect on tenofovir AUC, Cmax or Cmin. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and enteric-coated didanosine (250 mg simultaneously with tenofovir-DF and a light meal) decreased didanosine Cmax by 20% and had no effect on AUC when compared to values obtained with didanosine (400 mg) given alone under fasting conditions.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></p>
<p>Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. When didanosine gastro-resistant capsules were administered 2 hours prior to or concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the AUC for didanosine was on average increased by 48% and 60% respectively. The mean increase in the AUC of didanosine was 44% when the buffered tablets were administered 1 hour prior to tenofovir. In both cases the pharmacokinetic parameters for tenofovir administered with a light meal were unchanged. A reduced didanosine dose (250 mg) has been tested to avoid over-exposure to didanosine in case of co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but this has been associated with reports of high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage within several tested combinations. Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is therefore not recommended, especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4 cell count. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. If this combination is judged strictly necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for efficacy and didanosine related adverse events. <br />Triple NRTI Therapy:<br />There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage when didanosine was combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine as a once daily regimen. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. A dose reduction of didanosine taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended. Administer didanosine 250 mg once daily to adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min and didanosine 200 mg once daily to adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. The appropriate dose of didanosine coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min has not been established. Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily with a light meal) and didanosine (400 mg single dose, 2 h before tenofovir) was studied in 26 HIV-negative subjects. AUC and Cmax of ddI both increased by 48%. Data from 25 subjects showed no change in the AUC and Cmax of tenofovir. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (400 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 25 HIV-negative subjects. AUC and Cmax of ddI increased by 60% and 64% respectively. There was no change in the AUC and Cmax of tenofovir. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (200 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 250 mg given alone under fasting conditions, AUC of ddI increased by 16% and Cmax decreased by 12%. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (250 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 400 mg given alone under fasting conditions, there was no change in the AUC of ddI and a 20% decrease in Cmax. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (325 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 400 mg given alone under fasting conditions, AUC of ddI increased by 13% and Cmax decreased by 11%.<br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Intracellular concentrations of active phosphate metabolites were determined in three groups of HIV-infected subjects receiving didanosine alone (400 mg once daily, n=16), tenofovir (300 mg once daily, n=8) or didanosine/tenofovir (250/300 mg once daily, n =14). There were no significant differences in ddA-TP or TDF-DP when didanosine or tenofovir were administered alone or in combination. This study does not support the existence of a strong intracellular interaction between didanosine and tenofovir, but can not conclude that there is absolutely no interaction due to small sample size. As ddA-TP concentrations were similar when didanosine given alone (400 mg) or at a reduced dose (250 mg) with tenofovir, the study supports the dose adaptation proposed for this combination. <br /><em>Measurement of intracellular didanosine and tenofovir phosphorylated metabolites and possible interaction of the two drugs in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

Doxycycline is excreted in the urine and faeces as unchanged active substance (40- 60% of an administered dose can be accounted for in the urine). Studies indicate that administration of doxycycline at the recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation in patients with renal impairment. There is therefore little potential for a clinically significant interaction with tenofovir-DF via completion for renal elimination transport mechanisms.</span>

<p>No clinically significant drug interactions hace been observed between tenofovir-DF and efavirenz.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>Specific interaction studies have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than lamivudine, zidovudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Clinically significant interactions are not expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways. No dosage adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product. <br /><em>Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 14 days) to 29 subjects resulted in no change in Cmax, AUC or Cmin of either tenofovir or efavirenz. <br /><em>Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2015.</em></p>
<p>The interaction between tenofovir and efavirenz was assessed in TDM samples from groups of HIV+ patients receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily) alone or with tenofovir (300 mg once daily). Samples were collected 0.5-23.9 h post dose in the control group (n=118) and the tenofovir group (n=126). There was no significant difference between the groups for the time post dose or efavirenz concentrations (2.34 &#181;g/ml vs. 2.22 &#181;g/ml, control vs. plus tenofovir). <br /><em>Assessment of drug-drug interactions between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz in HIV-infected patients. Droste JA, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 41: 37-43. </em></p>
<p>Nine cases have been reported of patients stable on efavirenz therapy who developed neuropsychiatric disturbances following the introduction of tenofovir to their antiretroviral regimens. The patients had been stable on efavirenz-containing regimens for a median duration of 31 months (range 5-58) during which no efavirenz related CNS effects were reported. Moderate to severe neuropsychiatric events occurred within 48 h of starting tenofovir in 5 patients, with symptoms developing in the remaining 4 patients after 2 weeks to 24 months after initiation of tenofovir. Treatment was changed in 6/9 patients; 3 switched from tenofovir to nevirapine, 2 to from tenofovir to zidovudine and one discontinued treatment. All 6 patients exhibited marked improvement in CNS intolerance. Of the 3 patients who remained on efavirenz and tenofovir, one had spontaneous progressive improvement within 2 weeks, but two had chronic persistent sleeping disorders. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were available for 2 patients before tenofovir (1.35 and 2.09 &#181;g/ml) and for 4 patients on tenofovir (1.30-1.95 &#181;g/ml). The neuropsychiatric disorders could be either a consequence of an unexplained interaction between efavirenz and tenofovir, or an infrequent tenofovir-related side effect. Further studies are required to evaluate precisely the incidence of these symptoms, including the assessment of efavirenz binding sites or metabolites. <br /><em>Neuropsychiatric adverse events after switching from an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz without tenofovir to an efavirenz regimen containing tenofovir: a report of nine cases.

Empagliflozin is mainly glucuronidated by UGTs 1A3, 1A8, 1A9 and 2B7. It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. However, since an increased risk for bone fractures and decreased bone mineral density has been reported for other sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, caution is recommended when coadministering empagliflozin in the long term with tenofovir-DF due to potential additive bone toxicities.</p></span>

<p>Plasma amprenavir trough concentrations were similar for subjects receiving tenofovir disproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) in combination with fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily, n=45; 1400/200 mg once daily, n=60) when compared with a parallel control group not receiving tenofovir. <br /><em>Lexiva Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, April 2012.</em></p><div><div>A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor.

<p>The potential interaction between fosamprenavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was investigated in 36 healthy subjects who received tenofovir (300 mg once daily for 7 days, period 1), and then were randomized to 14 days of either fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) or fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) alone or with tenofovir (period 2). Subjects continued their randomized dose of fosamprenavir&#177;ritonavir for 14 more days (period 3), adding or removing tenofovir based upon its receipt in period 2. Plasma amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics were assessed on the last day of each period. Tenofovir Cmin, Cmax and AUC decreased by 12%, 25% and 15% after fosamprenavir coadministration and by 9%, 18% and 7% after fosamprenavir/ritonavir coadministration. Unboosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 3% and 7% after tenofovir coadministration; boosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 4% and 16% with tenofovir. No significant changes in ritonavir pharmacokinetics were observed. The authors conclude that the increases in amprenavir exposures and modest decreases in tenofovir exposures are unlikely to be clinically significant. <br /><em>Steady-state amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics after coadministration of unboosted or ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in healthy volunteers.

<p>This study was a prospective phase I crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers who received fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 or 1400/200 mg once daily) with or without tenofovir (300 mg once daily) for 14 days. Tenofovir was added or discontinued (cross over) for another 14 days, with pharmacokinetics being assessed on days 14 and 28. There was no effect of tenofovir on amprenavir AUC or Cmax in either regimen. Tenofovir led to significant increases in ritonavir AUC (32%) and Cmax (71%) when given with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg. However, the authors conclude that no dose modification is necessary when combining fosamprenavir/ritonavir with tenofovir. <br /><em>Fosamprenavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics: no effect of tenofovir.

<p>The interaction between TDF (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg once daily) was investigated in healthy male subjects. The 24 h PK profiles for APV were similar for the two groups. There was no effect of TDF on APV AUC in either the 100 mg (GMR=0.99) or 200 mg (GMR=1.06) RTV groups. APV Cmax was unaffected by TDF in the 100 mg group (GMR=1.04), whereas the 200 mg group showed a non-significant increase (GMR=1.11). APV Ctrough showed non-significant increases in both groups (100 mg GMR=1.24, 200 mg GMR=1.02). There was a non-significant trend to higher RTV AUC in the 200 mg group. TDF monophosphate AUC and Cmax showed a non-significant trend to being lower in the 200 mg group, but with a higher Ctrough. Coadministration of TDF with FPV/RTV was generally well tolerated and the absence of relevant interactions suggests that no dose modification is necessary. <br /><em>Coadministration of tenofovir 300 mg once daily with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg once daily or 1400/200 mg once daily does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics.

<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of the FPV/RTV-TDF interaction in HIV+ patients (n=21) receiving FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily) in combination with TDF (300 mg once daily). Median (range) trough concentrations were 1586 (867-2925) ng/ml for APV, 166 (30-615) ng/ml for RTV and 64 (31-226) ng/ml for TDF. Trough concentrations were in the adequate ranges and no clinically relevant PK interaction was found.<br /><em>Plasma concentrations of amprenavir, ritonavir and tenofovir in HIV-infected patients treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg BID) and tenofovir (300 mg QD) containing regimen.

This effect has been attributed to the induction of intestinal CYP3A4 and/or P-gp by garlic. Tenofovir-DF (the prodrug of tenofovir) is a substrate of P-gp and its absorption could decrease due to induction of intestinal P-gp by garlic.

Since tenofovir-DF is primarily eliminated by  the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce  renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase  serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of  other renally eliminated drugs.

<p>The plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and abacavir, lamivudine or lopinavir was investigated in HIV+ subjects receiving TDF + 3TC/LPV (n=7), TDF + 3TC/NVP (n=8), TDF + ABC/LPV (n=7) or TDF + ABC/NVP (n=5).

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was determined in 27 HIV-negative subjects. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir increase tenofovir AUC (32%), Cmax (15%) and Cmin (51%). Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were unaffected by tenofovir (n=24). Clinical estimates of renal function were unaffected by administration of tenofovir alone or with lopinavir/ritonavir.

<p>The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) on the renal clearance of tenofovir was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving tenofovir (300 mg once daily) alone or in combination with LPV/r. Tenofovir clearance was 16% lower in subjects receiving LPV/r, consistent with a renal interaction between tenofovir and LPV/r.

<p>Significant increases in TDF plasma exposure have been reported when coadministered with Kaletra. This study looked at the interaction at the intracellular level by investigating the effect of LPV/RTV (400/100 once daily) on TDF-DP concentrations in HIV+ patients taking TDF (300 mg once daily). There was a trend to higher TDF-DP concentrations when used in combination with LPV/r. However, due to interpatient variability, this did not reach statistical significance. Mean &#177; SD TDF-DP concentrations were 181.4 &#177; 80.1 and 280.3 &#177; 181.8 fmol/106 cells, alone and in combination with LPV/RTV respectively. Since target concentrations have yet to be defined for TDF-DP, the possible consequences of this increase remain unknown. <br /><em>Possible interaction between tenofovir and boosted lopinavir; analysis at the intracellular level in HIV infected patients.

<p>The effect of tenofovir on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir was investigated in 18 treatment experienced HIV+ patients. Lopinavir concentrations decreased in the presence of tenofovir (Cmin from 4.61 to 3.06 &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 10.68 to 9.65 &#181;g/ml).

If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is     co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored     adequately.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Tenofovir     DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic     agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory   drugs   (NSAIDs)). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high   dose   or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients   with  risk  factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on   tenofovir DF.  Some  patients required hospitalization and renal   replacement therapy.   Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if   needed, in patients at   risk for renal dysfunction. Since tenofovir-DF   is primarily eliminated   by the kidneys, coadministration of   tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce   renal function or compete for   active tubular secretion may increase   serum concentrations of   tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of   other renally   eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not   limited to,   cidofovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir,   valganciclovir,   aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or   multiple NSAIDs.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></div></span>

No a priori dose adjustment is recommended, but renal function should be monitored. [Note: coadministration of NSAIDs and tenofovir-DF may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity in particular if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure.

If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is      co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored      adequately.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Tenofovir      DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic      agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory    drugs   (NSAIDs)). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of  high   dose   or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected  patients   with  risk  factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable  on   tenofovir DF.  Some  patients required hospitalization and renal    replacement therapy.   Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if    needed, in patients at   risk for renal dysfunction. Since  tenofovir-DF   is primarily eliminated   by the kidneys,  coadministration of   tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce   renal  function or compete for   active tubular secretion may increase   serum  concentrations of   tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of    other renally   eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not    limited to,   cidofovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir,    valganciclovir,   aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or    multiple NSAIDs.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></div></span>

<p>The effect of tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine on the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine (200 mg twice daily) was studied in 7 HIV+, African-American subjects.

<p>The interaction between tenofovir-DF and nevirapine was assessed in TDM samples from groups of HIV+ patients receiving nevirapine (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily) alone or with tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily). For twice daily dosing, although nevirapine samples were collected at various times post dose (0.2-14.3 h), there was no significant difference in the times post dose between the control group (n=272) and the tenofovir group (n=39). Nevirapine concentrations were not significantly different between the groups (5.68 &#181;g/ml vs. 6.48 &#181;g/ml, control vs. tenofovir). For once daily dosing, samples were collected 0-24.4 h post dose in the control group (n=18) and the tenofovir group (n=94). There was no significant difference between the groups for the time post dose or nevirapine concentrations (5.25 &#181;g/ml vs. 4.85 &#181;g/ml, control vs. plus tenofovir). <br /><em>Assessment of drug-drug interactions between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz in HIV-infected patients.

<p>Trough nevirapine concentrations (23-25 h post dose) were obtained from patients undergoing routine TDM whilst receiving nevirapine (400 mg once daily). Geometric mean (CI) nevirapine troughs in 171 patients receiving nevirapine and tenofovir-DF were 3420 (3170-3670) ng/ml. Values for patients receiving nevirapine without tenofovir (n=87) were 3260 (2980-3540) ng/ml, suggesting that tenofovir does not affect nevirapine plasma concentrations. <br /><em>Nevirapine trough concentrations in HIV-infected patients treated with or without tenofovir.

If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Tenofovir DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)). Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Since tenofovir-DF is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to, cidofovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></div></span>

Oxcarbazepine is rapidly reduced by cytosolic arylketone reductases to its active metabolite, 10-hydroxycarbazepine.&nbsp;Oxcarbazepine might induce P-gp and therefore could reduce the absorption of tenofovir-DF. However, based on the results of the interaction study between tenofovir-DF and rifampicin, another inducer of P-gp, oxcarbazepine would be expected to cause only a small decrease in tenofovir-DF.</p></span>

The risk is increased if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure.

                    <span><div><div>Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple       non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in       patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with risk       factors for renal dysfunction. If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is       co-administered with an NSAID, renal function should be monitored       adequately.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em><br /><br />Tenofovir       DF should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a  nephrotoxic      agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory    drugs   (NSAIDs)). Cases of acute renal failure  after initiation of  high   dose   or multiple NSAIDs have been reported  in HIV-infected  patients   with  risk  factors for renal dysfunction  who appeared stable  on   tenofovir DF.  Some  patients required  hospitalization and renal    replacement therapy.   Alternatives to  NSAIDs should be considered, if    needed, in patients at   risk for  renal dysfunction. Since  tenofovir-DF   is primarily eliminated   by  the kidneys,  coadministration of   tenofovir-DF with drugs that reduce    renal  function or compete for   active tubular secretion may increase    serum  concentrations of   tenofovir and/or increase the  concentrations of    other renally   eliminated drugs. Some examples  include, but are not    limited to,   cidofovir, acyclovir,  valacyclovir, ganciclovir,    valganciclovir,   aminoglycosides (e.g.,  gentamicin), and high-dose or    multiple NSAIDs.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc, May 2015.</em></div></div></span>

                    <span><p>Tenofovir-DF may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir AUC by 49%, Cmax by 64% and Cmin by 3%. Tenofovir AUC decreased by 10%, Cmax by 33% and Cmin by 13%. From the clinical trials, a large proportion of patients used atazanavir and/or tenofovir-DF, both agents that result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens.The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and/or tenofovir-DF was generally similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore no dose adjustment is required. <br /><em>Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, </em><em>November 2014</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir Cmax by 64%, AUC by 49% and Cmin by 3% (n=9). Raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. <br /><em>Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, </em><em>February 2015</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily for 4 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily for 7 days) alone and in combination for 4 days was studied in HIV- subjects. Pharmacokinetic profiles were also determined in HIV+ patients given raltegravir monotherapy alone or in combination with tenofovir-DF/lamivudine. In healthy volunteers raltegravir AUC and Cmax were modestly increased in the presence of tenofovir-DF (49% and 64%, respectively), while there was no effect of tenofovir-DF on raltegravir Cmin (3% increase). However, there was a modest increase of 42% in Cmin in HIV-infected patients. Raltegravir only had a small effect on tenofovir-DF AUC (10% decrease), Cmax (23% decrease) and Cmin (13% decrease). The authors conclude that coadministration of raltegravir and tenofovir-DF does not change the pharmacokinetics of either drug to a clinically meaningful degree and consequently may be coadministered without dose adjustments. <br /><em>Lack of a significant interaction between raltegravir and tenofovir.

<p><br></p><p>The pharmacokinetic interaction of rifampicin (600 mg once daily) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) was assessed in 23 HIV-negative subjects. Coadministration of rifampicin reduced tenofovir AUC by 12%, Cmax by 16% and Cmin by 15%. However, 90% confidence intervals for these PK parameters were within the limits required for pharmacokinetic equivalence. Rifampicin pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable to historical controls. The addition of rifampicin to tenofovir-DF was well tolerated and the small decrease in tenofovir exposure suggests that these drugs can be coadministered without the need for dose adjustments.<br><em>Pharmacokinetic study of tenofovir disproxil fumarate combined with rifampin in healthy volunteers.

                    <span><div><div> When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with low dose  ritonavir (as lopinavir/ritonavir), there was no significant effect on  lopinavir/ritonavir PK parameters; tenofovir AUC and Cmin increased by  32% and 51%, but there was no change in Cmax. Coadministration as  darunavir/ritonavir had no significant effect on darunavir/ritonavir PK  parameters, but increased tenofovir AUC and Cmin by 22% and 37%. A  higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir or  cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of renal  function is required in these patients. In patients with renal risk  factors, the co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a  boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully evaluated.<br /> <em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em> <p>Coadministration of low dose ritonavir (coformulated as  lopinavir/ritonavir, 400/100 mg twice times daily for 14 days) and  tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 24 healthy  volunteers. There was no change in tenofovir Cmax; AUC and Cmin  increased by 32% and 51% respectively. There was no change in Cmax, AUC  or Cmin for lopinavir or ritonavir. When low dose ritonavir (100 mg  twice daily for 14 days) was coadministered with saquinavir (1000 mg  twice daily ) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) in 35 healthy  volunteers, there was no change in tenofovir AUC or Cmax, but Cmin  increased by 23%. There was no change in ritonavir Cmax or AUC, but Cmin  increased by 23%. <br /> <em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, May 2015.</em></p> <p>The coadministration of tenofovir diproxil fumarate (300 mg once  daily) was investigated in 18 HIV-1 infected individuals receiving  saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir combination (1000/100 mg twice daily). On  day 1, 12 h pharmacokinetic profiles for saquinavir and ritonavir were  obtained, tenofovir was then added to the regimen and blood sampling  repeated at days 3 and 14. Following the addition of tenofovir,  saquinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations were not significantly  different compared with day 1. Geometric mean ratios (95% confidence  intervals) for the AUC on days 3 and 14 were 1.16 (0.97, 1.59) and 0.99  (0.87, 1.30) for saquinavir and 1.05 (0.92, 1.28) and 1.08 (0.97, 1.30)  for ritonavir. <br /> <em>Pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice  daily) when administered with tenofovir diproxil fumarate in  HIV-1-infected subjects.

Br J  Clin Pharmacol, 2005, 59: 38-42.</em></p> <p>The effect of tenofovir on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and  ritonavir was investigated in 18 treatment experienced HIV+ patients.  Lopinavir concentrations decreased in the presence of tenofovir (Cmin  from 4.61 to 3.06 &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 10.68 to 9.65 &#181;g/ml). Decreases in  ritonavir concentrations were also observed (Cmin from 0.63 to 0.35  &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 1.02 to 0.72 &#181;g/ml). Therapeutic drug monitoring of  lopinavir when coadministered with tenofovir may be useful to indicate  if individual dose modification of lopinavir and/or ritonavir is  required. <br /> <em>Pharmacokinetic drug interaction of lopinavir/ritonavir in  combination with tenofovir in experienced HIV+ patients.

The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were not  substantially effected by saquinavir/ritonavir (Cmin, Cmax and AUC  increased by 23%, 15% and 14% respectively). Ritonavir exposure was  slightly increased; Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 23%, 10% and 11%  respectively. Saquinavir Cmin was moderately enhanced (47% increase);  Cmax and AUC increased by 22% and 29% respectively. All subjects  achieved a SQV Cmin above 100 ng/ml. <br /> <em>Pharmacokinetic assessment of tenofovir DF and ritonavir-boosted  saquinavir in healthy subjects.

In the presence of tenofovir, there were decreases  in ritonavir AUC (7011 to 5217 ng/ml.h), Cmax (886 to 642 ng/ml) and  Cmin (43 to 39 ng/ml).

Sacubitril is rapidly converted to LBQ657 (active metabolite) by carboxylesterases and the active metabolite is not further metabolized to a significant extent. Sacubitril inhibits OATP1B1 and LBQ657 is a substrate of OATP1B1/3, OAT1 and OAT3. Tenofovir is eliminated via OAT1 and therefore could potentially compete with LBQ657 renal elimination (clinical relevance is unclear).

<p>Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) was evaluated in 18 HIV+ subjects. There was no change in the AUC or Cmax of saquinavir. <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was coadministered with ritonavir-boosted saquinavir. A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of renal function is required in these patients. In patients with renal risk factors, the co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully evaluated.<br /><em>Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 35 healthy volunteers. There was no change in tenofovir AUC or Cmax, but Cmin increased by 23%. Saquinavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 22%, 29% and 47%, respectively. There was no change in ritonavir Cmax or AUC, but Cmin increased by 23%. The increases in saquinavir AUC and Cmin are not expected to be clinically relevant; hence no dose adjustments are required when tenofovir-DF and ritonavir-boosted saquinavir are coadministered. <br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, May 2015.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) were assessed in HIV-negative subjects. No clinically relevant interactions between tenofovir-DF and saquinavir/ritonavir were noted. Steady state tenofovir pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered in the presence of saquinavir/ritonavir (increases of 14% in AUC, 15% in Cmax, 23% in Cmin, n=35). Coadministration of tenofovir-DF to 32 subjects resulted in increases in saquinavir AUC (29%), Cmax (22%) and Cmin (47%). Steady state ritonavir Cmin increased by 23% in the presence of tenofovir-DF, but ritonavir AUC and Cmax were not significantly altered.

<p>The coadministration of tenofovir diproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 18 HIV-1 infected individuals receiving saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir combination (1000/100 mg twice daily). On day 1, 12 h pharmacokinetic profiles for saquinavir and ritonavir were obtained, tenofovir was then added to the regimen and blood sampling repeated at days 3 and 14. Following the addition of tenofovir-DF, saquinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations were not significantly different compared with day 1. Geometric mean ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the AUC on days 3 and 14 were 1.16 (0.97, 1.59) and 0.99 (0.87, 1.30) for saquinavir and 1.05 (0.92, 1.28) and 1.08 (0.97, 1.30) for ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) when administered with tenofovir diproxil fumarate in HIV-1-infected subjects.

<div>The interaction between sofosbuvir and tenofovir was evaluated in clinical trials and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily with emtricitabine and efavirenz) and sofosbuvir (400 mg single dose) was studied in 16 subjects. Sofosbuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 19% and 6%, respectively, with GS-331007 Cmax and AUC decreasing by 23% and 16%, respectively.

<div>Coadministration of a single dose of sofosbuvir (400 mg) before and after 14 days of Atripla (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF 600/200/300 mg once daily) was studied in 16 subjects. Cmax of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were slightly decreased (~20-23%) in the presence of sofosbuvir.

Despite adequate hydration and daily examination of urine for sulphadiazine crystals, renal function deteriorated suddenly after 13 days of sulphadiazine therapy. Obstructive uropathy due to bilateral ureteric stones with hydronephrosis occurred, resulting in rapid onset renal failure. Sulphadiazine was discontinued and clindamycin was substituted. With intravenous fluid hydration and bilateral nephrostomies the urolithiasis resolved. Sulphadiazine and its hepatic metabolite acetylsulphadiazine are excreted via the renal tract; they are poorly soluble in urine and may potentially precipitate in the acid environment, producing crystalluria and stones. Crystalluria is common, may occur in up to 28% of patients taking sulphadiazine, and is potentially nephrotoxic via both direct chemical irritation of the tubular epithelium and tubular obstruction due to urolithiasis.&nbsp; The authors suggest that if outpatient treatment of toxoplasmosis is contemplated, careful attention to fluid balance, daily checking of urine for the presence of crystalluria, and frequent monitoring of biochemical renal function (3 times a week) are required in order to avoid this potentially serious complication of treatment.<em>Sulphadiazine-induced obstructive renal failure complicating treatment of HIV-associated toxoplasmosis.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolic profiles of both drugs there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.</span>

<p>In a study, 20 subjects started telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) followed by efavirenz/tenofovir-DF (600/300 mg once daily for 7 days) after a washout. Subsequently, they received telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 hours and efavirenz/tenofovir-DF 600/300 mg once daily for 7 days or telaprevir 1500 mg every 12 hours and efavirenz/tenofovir-DF 600/300 mg once daily for 7 days in a randomized order without a washout. When compared to data from telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone, the AUC and Cmin of telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 h decreased by 18% and 25%, but the AUC and Cmin of telaprevir 1500 every 12 h decreased by 20% and 48%. Efavirenz AUC and Cmin decreased by 18% and 10% with telaprevir 1125 mg every 8h, and decreased by 15% and 11% with telaprevir 1500 every 12 h. Tenofovir AUC and Cmin increased by 10% and 17% with telaprevir 1125 mg every 8h, and increased by 10% and 6% with telaprevir 1500 every 12 h.<br>

</em>&nbsp;<br>
In an open label, randomised, 3 way crossover study in HCV/HIV negative healthy volunteers (n=16), subjects received tenofovir-DF 300 mg or telaprevir 750 mg three times daily for 7 days, then a combination of both agents for 7 days. Tenofovir-DF had no effect on telaprevir AUC, Cmax or Cmin. Exposure to tenofovir was increased ~30% when co-administered with telaprevir.<br>

The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Epclusa and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration of Epclusa with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Epclusa concomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of Product Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring.<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Epclusa Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, July 2016.</em></p>
