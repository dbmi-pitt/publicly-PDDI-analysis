                    <span>Adrenaline is a naturally occurring catecholamine secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to exertion or stress. Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated in the body, mostly in the liver by the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Much of a dose of adrenaline is excreted as metabolites in urine. The plasma half-life is about 2-3 minutes. However, when given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, local vasoconstriction may delay absorption so that the effects may last longer than the half-life suggests.<br /><em>Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Injection BP 1 in 1000 UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hameln pharmaceuticals ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

Alcuronium neuromuscular block, plasma concentration, and renal elimination (HPLC assay) were measured during the 12-h after its administration. Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

                    <span><p>Co-administration of didanosine and allopurinol results in increased systemic exposure to didanosine, which can result in didanosine-associated toxicity. When didanosine and allopurinol were co-administered (14 healthy volunteers), the AUC and the Cmax for didanosine significantly increased 105% and 71%, respectively. Therefore, co-administration of allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) with didanosine is not recommended. Patients treated with didanosine who require allopurinol administration should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen or should be closely monitored for didanosine related undesirable effects.<br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration is contraindicated because systemic exposures of didanosine are increased, which may increase didanosine-associated toxicity. The effect of allopurinol (300 mg/day for 7 days) on the pharmacokinetics of didanosine (400 mg single dose) was investigated in healthy volunteers (n=14). Didanosine AUC increased 1.13-fold and Cmax increased by 69%. When allopurinol (300 mg/day for 7 days) and a 200 mg single dose of didanosine was studied in 2 subjects with renal impairment, didanosine AUC increased by 312% and Cmax increased by 232%. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, November 2011.</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion. After oral administration, approximately 20-40% is excreted unchanged in the urine, whereas about 60-80% is excreted unchanged in the urine after parenteral administration. As didanosine is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. When administered orally, there is little potential for significant interaction.</span>

Metabolic turnover appears to be greater in females than males. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body and after an intravenous dose, about 40% is excreted in 8 hours, which is increased to about 70% after tissue saturation. The amount of unchanged drug is dose dependent; in women the excretion of ascorbic acid appears to vary with the stage of the menstrual cycle and it is decreased when taking oral contraceptives.

<p>Pancreatitis is a known serious complication among HIV infected patients. It has also been associated with didanosine therapy (&lt;1% of patients) and has been fatal in some cases. Didanosine should be used only with extreme caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Positive relationships have been found between the risk of pancreatitis and daily dose of didanosine. Whenever warranted by clinical conditions, didanosine should be suspended until the diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded by appropriate laboratory and imaging techniques. Similarly, when treatment with other medicinal products known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, didanosine should be suspended whenever possible. If concomitant therapy is unavoidable, close observation is warranted. Dose interruption should be considered when biochemical markers of pancreatitis have significantly increased, even in the absence of symptoms. Significant elevations of triglycerides are a known cause of pancreatitis and warrant close observation. <br /><em>Videx EC&#174; (didanosine) gastroresistant capsules, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Limited, updated February 2010</em></p></span>

<div>Coadministration of atazanavir with didanosine buffered tablets resulted in a marked decrease in atazanavir exposure. It is recommended that atazanavir be given (with food) 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine buffered formulations. Simultaneous administration of didanosine EC and atazanavir with food results in a decrease in didanosine exposure but has no significant effect on atazanavir exposures. Thus, atazanavir and didanosine EC should be administered at different times. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg single dose) with didanosine buffered tablets (200 mg single dose) did not alter exposure to didanosine (8% and 2% reduction in Cmax and AUC respectively, n=31); however, exposure to atazanavir was markedly decreased (Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 89%, 87% and 84% respectively, n =31.

Reduced plasma didanosine exposure was observed when didanosine was administered with atazanavir (or atazanavir/ritonavir) and food consistent with the effect of food previously observed on didanosine. Both drugs should therefore be administered as per their current dosing recommendations but at different times: didanosine in the fasted state and atazanavir with food.</div>

                    <span>Benznidazole is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral doses (&gt; 90% bioavailability) and is widely distributed throughout the body. More than 40% of the drug is bound to plasma protein. The peak plasma concentration occurs after 3 to 4 hours and the half-life is about 12 hours. It is metabolised in the liver and more than 70% of the metabolites are excreted by the kidneys; about 30% of a dose is excreted in the faeces.<br /><em>Raaflaub J, Ziegler WH.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span>The primary UGT enzymes responsible for chloramphenicol O-glucuronidation were evaluated in vitro. Reaction phenotyping for the glucuronidation of chloramphenicol with 12 expressed human liver UGT isoforms has identified UGT2B7 as having the highest activity for 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9. The formation of 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronide by pooled HLM and expressed UGT2B7 exhibited substrate inhibition kinetics with apparent K(m) values of 408.2 and 115.0 microM, respectively. Azidothymidine (AZT) and hyodeoxycholic acid (substrates of UGT2B7) inhibited 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation in pooled HLMs. In 10 donor HLM preparations, both chloramphenicol 3-O- and chloramphenicol 1-O-glucuronidation showed a significant correlation with AZT glucuronidation (UGT2B7) at 30 microM chloramphenicol. These results suggest that UGT2B7 is the primary human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform catalyzing 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9.<br /><em>Identification of human UGT2B7 as the major isoform involved in the O-glucuronidation of chloramphenicol.

About 22% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.<br /><em>Piriton&#174; (Chlorphenamine) Tablets&nbsp; UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, updated May 2010</em></p>
<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

                    <span><p>Unlike the didanosine chewable/dispersible tablets, didanosine gastro-resistant capsules do not contain antacids and therefore drug interactions mediated by altered gastric pH are not anticipated when didanosine gastro-resistant capsules are co-administered with medicinal products where absorption is influenced by gastric acidity. Specific interaction studies with ciprofloxacin showed no evidence of significant interaction. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of didanosine EC (400 mg single dose) and ciprofloxacin (750 mg single dose) to 16 HIV-negative subjects resulted in no change in the AUC and Cmax of ciprofloxacin. When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg twice daily for 3 days) was coadministered with ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily for 3 days, 2 h before ddI) to 8 HIV-infected subjects, ddI AUC and Cmax decreased by 16% and 28%, respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The effect of the didanosine encapsulated enteric coated beadlet formulation (400 mg) on ciprofloxacin (750 mg) was evaluated in 16 healthy volunteers. The geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were 8.1% and 9.1% lower, respectively, when given in combination. However, 90% CI of the ratios of the geometric means fell within the criteria defined for a lack of interaction (0.75 to 1.33). Didanosine as this formulation did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and the drugs may be administered simultaneously. <br /><em>Lack of effect of simultaneously administered didanosine encapsulated enteric bead formulation (Videx EC) on oral absorption of indinavir, ketoconazole and ciprofloxacin. Damle BD, et al. Antimicrob Agent Chemother, 2002, 46:385-391. </em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of didanosine and ciprofloxacin were evaluated following administration of didanosine (200 mg twice daily, buffered tablets) and ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) to 16 HIV-infected subjects as single agents or in combination (ciprofloxacin 2 h prior to didanosine). When coadministered, there were statistically significant decreases in ciprofloxacin AUC (26%) and urinary recovery (29%), though these were not considered to be clinically significant. Other than a decrease in didanosine AUC (16%), ciprofloxacin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of didanosine. <br /><em>A multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction study between didanosine (Videx) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) in male subjects seropositive for HIV but asymptomatic. Knupp CA, et al. Biopharmac Drug Dis, 1997, 18: 65-77. </em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) were determined in a HIV-negative subject on four occasions following administration of ciprofloxacin alone, 2 h before didanosine-placebo buffered tablets, 2 h after didanosine-placebo buffered tablets and concomitantly with didanosine-placebo buffered tablets. Administration of ciprofloxacin concurrently or 2 h after the antacids in the placebo tablet reduced ciprofloxacin concentrations to below the minimum inhibitory concentration for moderately sensitive microorganisms. Administration of ciprofloxacin 2 h before the antacids resulted in normal concentrations. The results from this single subject suggest that ciprofloxacin should be given either 2 h before or at least 6 h after administration of didanosine buffered tablets. <br /><em>Avoiding the ciprofloxacin-didanosine interaction. Sahai J. Ann Intern Med, 1995, 123: 394-395. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin (750 mg) administered alone and immediately after didanosine-placebo buffered tablets were determined in 12 HIV-negative subjects. Significant decreases in ciprofloxacin Cmax (from 3.38&#177;0.63 to 0.25&#177;0.21 &#181;g/ml) and AUC (from 15.5&#177;2.69 to 0.26&#177;0.21 &#181;g.h/ml) were seen when coadministered with the buffered tablets. The simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin and didanosine should be avoided.Cations in the didanosine tablet reduce ciprofloxacin bioavailability. Sahai J, et al. Clin Pharmacol Ther, 1993, 53: 292-297. </em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the 14C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.<br /><em>Clomid&#174; (clomiphene citrate tablets USP) US Prescribing Information, Sanofi-aventis U.S. revised June 2006</em></p>
<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

                    <span><p>Daunorubicin hydrochloride is mainly metabolized in the liver; each accompanying medication influencing liver function may also influence the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin hydrochloride and as a consequence influence efficacy and/or toxicity. Daunorubicin is rapidly taken up by tissues, especially by the kidneys, spleen, liver and heart. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier, subsequent release of drug and its metabolites from the tissues is slow (t&#189; = 55 hours). Daunorubicin is rapidly metabolised in the liver. The major metabolite daunorubicinol is also active. Daunorubicin is excreted slowly in the urine, mainly as metabolites with 25% excreted in the first 5 days. Biliary excretion also makes a significant (40%) contribution to elimination. <br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></p>
<div>The plasma pharmacokinetics of DaunoXome(daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) differ significantly from the results reported for conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. DaunoXome has a small steady-state volume of distribution of 6.4 L, (probably because it is confined to vascular fluid volume), and clearance of 17 mL/min. These differences in the volume of distribution and clearance result in a higher daunorubicin exposure (in terms of plasma AUC) from DaunoXome than with conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride. The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life. Daunorubicinol, the major active metabolite of daunorubicin, was detected at low levels in the plasma following intravenous administration of DaunoXome.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em>

<div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, or zidovudine). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

                    <span>Diethylcarbamazine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and also through the skin and conjunctiva. It is widely distributed in tissues and is mainly excreted in the urine unchanged and as the N-oxide metabolite. Urinary excretion and hence plasma half-life is dependent on urinary pH. About 5% of a dose is eliminated in the faeces. Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In the gut, diloxanide furoate is largely, if not wholly, hydrolysed into diloxanide and furoic acid under the combined action of bacterial and gut esterases. After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces.

Following IV administration, the onset of action of dopamine occurs within 5 minutes, and the drug has a duration of action of less than 10 minutes. Dopamine is metabolised in the liver, kidneys, and plasma by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals.

The coadministration of emtricitabine, didanosine and efavirenz was studied in 9 treatment naive, HIV+ patients. When compared to historical data for each drug alone, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine were not affected, didanosine AUC and Cmax were higher than expected and efavirenz Cmax, Cmin and AUC were lower than expected.

<p>Eflornithine was administered to six healthy men in single intravenous doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg and oral doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were reached within 6 hr after oral doses. The decay of the plasma concentrations followed first-order kinetics with a mean half-life (t 1/2) for all four doses studied of 199 +/- 6 min (+/- SD). Mean renal clearance was determined as 0.99 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . kg-1, accounting for 83% of drug elimination. Mean apparent volume of distribution (aVD) was 0.337 +/- 0.031 l/kg-1, corresponding to 24 l for 70 kg of body weight. The amount of unchanged drug in 24-hr urine samples was 47 +/- 7% and 40 +/- 11% after 10 and 20 mg/kg orally, and 78% and 81 +/- 8% after 5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously. Twenty-four-hour urinary recovery of unchanged drug was 46.9% of the 10mg/kg and 40.3% of the 20 mg/kg oral doses. &gt;86% of the oral doses were cleared from the body by renal filtration. In the case of intravenous dosing, 81% of the drug was eliminated by the kidneys. <br /><em>Kinetics of alpha-difluoromethylornithine: an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase.

Metabolism is presumed to occur in the liver and 6 metabolites have been isolated: 2-ethylisonicotinamide, carbonyl-dihydropyridine, thiocarbonyl-dihydropyridine, S-oxocarbamoyl dihydropyridine, 2-ethylthioiso-nicotinamide, and ethionamide sulphoxide. The sulphoxide metabolite has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

<p>The interaction between etravirine and didanosine was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of didanosine (400 mg once daily) and etravirine was studied in 15 subjects. Etravirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 16%, 11% and 5%, respectively. Data from 14 subjects showed that didanosine Cmax and AUC decreased by 9% and 1%.<br /><em>Intelence Prescribing Information, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2012.</em></p>
<p>The steady state pharmacokinetic interaction between etravirine (800 mg twice daily, phase II formulation) and ddI (400 mg once daily) was studied in healthy volunteers (n=14). Etravirine was administered with food 2 h after administration of ddI. In the presence of ddI, etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased 11%, 16% and 4% respectively. ddI AUC and Cmax decreased 1% and 9% respectively in the presence of etravirine. The combination was generally safe and well tolerated. The lack of clinically relevant interactions means that no dosage adjustments are necessary when etravirine is combined with ddI. <br /><em>No significant interaction between TMC125 and didanosine in healthy volunteers.

<p>Coadministration of single doses of enteric coated didanosine (400 mg) and fluconazole (200 mg) was studied in 14 HIV-negative subjects. The Cmax and AUC of fluconazole given as a single agent or in combination were similar. Statistical analysis indicated that both parameters satisfied the criteria for a lack of drug interaction (90% CI equivalence interval 0.80-1.25); 90% CI on geometric mean point estimates were 0.99-1.03 for AUC and 0.93-1.03 for Cmax.

<p>The disposition and metabolic fate of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T) were evaluated both in isolated hepatocytes and in nonhuman primates. Rapid formation of thymine and beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) occurred following incubation of hepatocytes with 10 microM [5(-3)H]D4T. Substantial levels of tritiated water were also detected. Exposure of cells to D4T in the presence of either 1 mM thymine or 10 microM benzyloxybenzyluracil, an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, decreased intracellular BAIBA levels by approximately 89 and 63%, respectively. Concurrently, [3H]thymine levels increased two- to fivefold. These results are consistent with D4T being cleaved to thymine, which is then degraded to BAIBA. A similar metabolic disposition was observed in monkeys following administration of 25 mg of [5(-3)H]D4T per kg of body weight. Approximately 50% of the administered dose was recovered in urine within 24 h, with the majority of the radioactivity representing unchanged drug. <br /><em>Cretton EM, Zhou Z, Kidd LB, In vitro and in vivo disposition and metabolism of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine.

                    <span><p>Coadministration of didanosine with ganciclovir may result in didanosine-associated toxicities. Patients should be closely monitored. Administration of didanosine 2 hours prior to, or concurrent with, ganciclovir was associated with a mean increase of 111% in the steady state AUC for didanosine. A minor decrease (21%) in the steady state AUC of ganciclovir was seen when didanosine was given 2 hours prior to ganciclovir, but not when both medicines were given simultaneously. There were no changes in renal clearance for either drug. It is not known whether these changes are associated with alterations in either the safety of didanosine or the efficacy of ganciclovir. There is no evidence that didanosine potentiates the myelosuppressive effects of ganciclovir. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration increases didanosine concentrations. If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with Videx-EC with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg twice daily) was coadministered with ganciclovir (1000 mg three times daily, 2 h after ddI) to 12 HIV-negative subjects, ddI AUC increased by 111% and ganciclovir AUC decreased by 21%. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of didanosine (200 mg twice daily) simultaneously with or 2 h before ganciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV-infected subjects. There were statistically significant decreases in the ganciclovir AUC (23%), Cmax (22%) and Cmin (21%) when given 2 h after didanosine. No significant differences were observed when the two drugs were given simultaneously. There was no significant difference in half life or renal clearance of ganciclovir when the two drugs were administered simultaneously or sequentially. Ganciclovir (simultaneous, sequential) significantly increased didanosine AUC (107%, 115%) and Cmax (108%, 116%). There were statistically significant increases in percentage ddI excreted unchanged in the urine, but no change in renal clearance. When all pharmacokinetic parameters were compared during sequential or simultaneous administration, there were no significant differences. The increased didanosine exposure may result in increased didanosine concentration-related toxicities; similarly, decreases in ganciclovir concentrations may impair its efficacy. For HIV-infected subjects receiving ganciclovir and didanosine, clinicians should recommend administering the two drug simultaneously and patients should be monitored closely for ddI-associated toxicities. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of oral ganciclovir alone and in combination with zidovudine, didanosine and probenecid in HIV-infected subjects.

<p>This study investigated the interaction between high dose oral ganciclovir (2000 mg three times daily) and didanosine (200 mg twice daily) in HIV-infected subjects. Didanosine data were available on 12 subjects and ganciclovir data on 8 subjects. When ganciclovir was administered either before didanosine, increases in didanosine AUC (87.3%) and Cmax (58.6%) were observed; when administered 2 h after didanosine, increases in didanosine AUC and Cmax of 100% and 124% were observed. There were no significant effects of didanosine on the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir, irrespective of sequence of administration. Although the combination was well tolerated in this short term study (3 days), there remains a concern that with long term administration increased didanosine exposure may increase the prevalence of didanosine related side effects. <br /><em>Effect of high-dose oral ganciclovir on didanosine disposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients.

<p>Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration.&nbsp; After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches, but does not equal, the daily dose administered.&nbsp; As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys.&nbsp; Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine of some patients weeks after drug administration was discontinued.&nbsp; Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine. Probenecid does not affect renal tubular transport of gentamicin.<br /><em>Gentamicin Injection USP, US Prescribing Information, APP Pharmaceuticals, revised August 2011</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <span>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

Interactions with the old formulation that were due to the presence of antacid should not apply to the new formulation. Timing of administration of Videx EC with other medications will still be dependent on food requirements, but no longer on gastric pH requirements.</em></p>
<p>Unlike the didanosine chewable/dispersible tablets, didanosine gastro-resistant capsules do not contain antacids and therefore drug interactions mediated by altered gastric pH are not anticipated when didanosine gastro-resistant capsules are co-administered with medicinal products where absorption is influenced by gastric acidity. Specific interaction studies with indinavir showed no evidence of significant interaction. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of didanosine EC (400 mg single dose) and indinavir (800 mg single dose) to 23 HIV-negative subjects resulted in no change in the AUC and Cmax of indinavir. When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg single dose) was coadministered simultaneously with indinavir (single dose) to 16 HIV-negative subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. When the same doses were administered 1 h apart (indinavir 1 h before didanosine), the AUC and Cmax of ddI decreased by 17% and 13% respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>No formal interaction study has been performed. A normal (acidic) gastric pH may be necessary for optimum absorption of indinavir whereas acid rapidly degrades didanosine which is formulated with buffering agents to increase pH. Antiretroviral activity was unaltered when didanosine was administered 3 hours after treatment with indinavir. Indinavir and didanosine formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach. Coadministration of enteric-coated didanosine (400 mg single dose) and indinavir (800 mg single dose) had no effect on indinavir or didanosine concentrations. Enteric-coated didanosine can be administered without any restrictions with respect to time of administration or food. <br /><em>Crixivan Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Ltd, <em>February 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>If indinavir and buffer-containing didanosine formulations are administered concomitantly, they should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach. <br /><em>Crixivan Prescribing Information, Merck &amp; Co Inc, <em>April 2012</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of single doses of enteric-coated ddI (400 mg) and indinavir/ritonavir (1200/400 mg) and the effect of food were investigated in 8 HIV-negative subjects. When given with food, the addition of ddI had no significant effect on indinavir AUC (5% decrease) or Cmax (3% decrease). However, when indinavir/ritonavir and didanosine were given two hours after food, there was no significant effect on indinavir AUC (5% decrease), but a 14% increase in IDV Cmax when compared to indinavir/ritonavir given alone and with food. When given two hours after food, the addition of indinavir/ritonavir significantly reduced ddI exposure (23% decrease in AUC, 42% decrease in Cmax). Coadministration with food resulted in a similar decrease in Cmax (46%), but lessened the effect on ddI AUC (4% decrease). If ddI and indinavir/ritonavir are used in combination, the most favourable pharmaockinetics are obtained if dosed with food. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction study of indinavir/ritonavir and the enteric-coated capsule formulation of didanosine in healthy volunteers. la Porte C, Verweij-van Wissen C, van Ewijk N, et al. J Clin Pharmacol, 2005, 45(2): 211-218.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800mg three times daily) and a single dose of didanosine (400 mg given 1 hour before indinavir) was studied in 12 HIV+ individuals. Didanosine had little effect on indinavir exposure when taken 1 h before indinavir. Administration of didanosine and indinavir should be separated by 1 h, although the gastric buffering effects of a 400 mg dose of didanosine appears to persist for ~90 minutes.<br /><em>If taken 1 hour before indinavir, didanosine does not affect indinavir exposure despite persistent buffering effects.

<p>The effect of the ddI encapsulated enteric coated beadlet formulation (400 mg) on indinavir (800 mg) was evaluated in 23 healthy volunteers. It was found that ddI as this formulation did not affect the pharmacokinetics of indinavir and the drugs may be administered simultaneously. <br /><em>Lack of effect of simultaneously administerd didanosine encapsulated enteric bead formulation (Videx EC) on oral absorption of indinavir, ketoconazole and ciprofloxacin.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p></span>

<p>Coadministration of single doses of enteric coated didanosine (400 mg) and itraconazole (200 mg) was studied in 25 HIV-negative subjects. The Cmax and AUC of itraconazole given as a single agent or in combination were similar. Statistical analysis indicated that Cmax satisfied the criteria for a lack of drug interaction (90% CI equivalence interval 0.75-1.33); 90% CI on geometric mean point estimates for Cmax was 0.79-1.20. The AUC of itraconazole decreased by 12% in the presence of didanosine; 90% CI on geometric mean point estimates for AUC were 0.71-1.09, indicating an indeterminate effect on AUC. The slight decrease in itraconazole AUC is not likely to significantly influence its antifungal activity. <br /><em>Absence of clinically relevant drug interactions following simultaneous administration of didanosine-encapsulated enteric-coated bead formulation with either itraconazole or fluconazole.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of itraconazole (200 mg single dose) were determined in 6 HIV-negative subjects alone and when given with didanosine (300 mg, buffered tablets dispersed in 240 ml water).

                    <span><p>Unlike the didanosine chewable/dispersible tablets, didanosine gastro-resistant capsules do not contain antacids and therefore drug interactions mediated by altered gastric pH are not anticipated when didanosine gastro-resistant capsules are co-administered with medicinal products where absorption is influenced by gastric acidity. Specific interaction studies with ketoconazole showed no evidence of significant interaction. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of didanosine EC (400 mg single dose) and ketoconazole (200 mg single dose) to 21 HIV-negative subjects resulted in no change in the AUC and Cmax of ketoconazole. When the buffered formulation of ddI (375 mg twice daily for 4 days) was coadministered with ketoconazole (200 mg once daily for 4 days, 2 h before ddI) to 12 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC and a 12% decrease in Cmax. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The effect of the didanosine encapsulated enteric coated beadlet formulation (400 mg) on ketoconazole (200 mg) was evaluated in 21 healthy volunteers. The geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were similar (&lt;3% difference) when given alone or in combination and 90% CI of the ratios of the geometric means fell within the criteria defined for a lack of interaction (0.75 to 1.33). Didanosine as this formulation did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole and the drugs may be administered simultaneously. <br /><em>Lack of effect of simultaneously administered didanosine encapsulated enteric bead formulation (Videx EC) on oral absorption of indinavir, ketoconazole and ciprofloxacin. Damle BD, et al. Antimicrob Agent Chemother, 2002, 46:385-391. </em></p>
<p>The steady state pharmacokinetics of didanosine (375 mg twice daily) and ketoconazole (200 mg daily) were evaluated when given alone or in combination (ketoconazole 2 h prior to didanosine) to 12 HIV-infected subjects. There was a statistically significant reduction (12%) in didanosine Cmax when given with ketoconazole (1836 ng/ml) than alone (2094 ng/ml). Didanosine AUC was reduced by 8% when given in combination (2872 ng.h/ml) than alone (3107 ng.h/ml). There were no significant differences in ketoconazole pharmacokinetics when give alone or with didanosine. Coadministration of didanosine and ketoconazole does not result in a clinically significant interaction and it is not necessary to alter the dosing regimen of either drug as alone as ketoconazole is administered 2 h before ddI. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of didanosine and ketoconazole after coadministration to patients seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of single doses of didanosine (300 mg) when given alone or 1 h after the final of 4 doses of loperamide (4 mg each) were determined in 12 HIV-infected subjects. Mean Cmax was significantly higher when given alone (2.04 &#181;g/ml) than with loperamide (1.57 &#181;g/ml). No significant treatment effect was observed for AUC (3.48 vs. 3.22 &#181;g.h/ml, alone vs. combination).

The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

Adverse effects were observed in 14 (56%) VL episodes. In 7 (28%), treatment with MA was permanently discontinued due to serious adverse effects that included acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and leukopenia. Three (12%) patients died during therapy due to severe acute pancreatitis attributable to MA. MA used at the doses studied was associated with a high rate of serious side effects in HIV-1-infected patients.<br /><em>High frequency of serious side effects from meglumine antimoniate given without an upper limit dose for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in human immunodeficiency virus type-1-infected patients.

<p>The medical charts of 54 Ethiopian visceral leishmaniasis patients treated with meglumine antimoniate were reviewed to assess the effectiveness and safety profile in a routine healthcare setting. None of the patients from south Ethiopia (n=24) and 46.4% of the patients from north Ethiopia (n=30) were HIV co-infected. 33 non-serious and 6 serious adverse events (two pancreatitis, one renal failure and three deaths) were observed in 26 patients. One-third of the non-serious adverse events were due to biochemical pancreatitis. During treatment, a case-fatality rate of 10.0% in north Ethiopia and 0.0% in south Ethiopia was noted. These data point to clinical pancreatitis as a safety concern, especially in patients with HIV co-infection.<br /><em>Safety and effectiveness of meglumine antimoniate in the treatment of Ethiopian visceral leishmaniasis patients with and without HIV co-infection.

<p>Pancreatitis is a known serious complication among HIV infected patients. It has also been associated with didanosine therapy (&lt;1% of patients) and has been fatal in some cases. Didanosine should be used only with extreme caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Positive relationships have been found between the risk of pancreatitis and daily dose of didanosine. Whenever warranted by clinical conditions, didanosine should be suspended until the diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded by appropriate laboratory and imaging techniques. Similarly, when treatment with other medicinal products known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, didanosine should be suspended whenever possible. If concomitant therapy is unavoidable, close observation is warranted. Dose interruption should be considered when biochemical markers of pancreatitis have significantly increased, even in the absence of symptoms. <br /><em>Videx EC&#174; (didanosine) gastroresistant capsules, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Limited, updated February 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study investigated the role of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase in the oxidation of 6- mercaptopurine. 6-mercaptopurine was incubated with bovine milk xanthine oxidase or partially purified guinea pig liver molybdenum hydroxylase fractions in the absence and presence of xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase inhibitor/substrates, and the reactions were monitored by spectrophotometric and HPLC methods. According to the results obtained from the inhibition studies, it is more likely that 6- mercaptopurine is oxidized to 6-thiouric acid via 6-thioxanthine rather than 8-oxo-6-mercaptopurine. The first step which is the rate limiting step is catalyzed solely by xanthine oxidase, whereas both xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase are involved in the oxidation of 6-thioxanthine to 6-thiouric acid<br /><em>In vitro study of 6-mercaptopurine oxidation catalysed by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase.

<p>2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddI) has potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is converted within target cells to its active form dideoxyadenosine triphosphate(ddA-TP). 2. In addition to the intracellular formation of ddA-TP, ddI can be broken down to hypoxanthine, by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and to uric acid, by xanthine oxidase. Since PNP is present in red blood cells we have examined the metabolism of [14C]-ddI by human blood. 3. When incubated with whole blood at 37 degrees C, ddI was extensively metabolised, principally to hypoxanthine (50.4 +/- 12.5% formed at 6 h; mean +/- s.d.; n = 16). Small amounts of uric acid were formed (3.8 +/- 2.4%). 4. ddI breakdown was temperature dependent, being virtually negligible at 4 degrees C. Metabolism to hypoxanthine occurred within red blood cells. 5. The short half-life of ddI in patients is probably the result of both hepatic and erythrocytic metabolism.<br /><em>Back DJ, Ormesher S, Tjia JF, Macleod R.

                    <span><p>Increases in serum- and urinary-amylase activity accompanied by fever and suggestive of pancreatitis have been associated with methyldopa in various case reports. Symptoms reappeared on rechallenge in 3 patients. In contrast to the acute form, chronic pancreatitis is not generally attributable to drug use. However, a case of florid chronic pancreatitis, with exocrine and endocrine insufficiency and heavy calcification over 30 months, associated with 2 periods of methyldopa treatment, has been reported. <br /><em>van der Heide H, et al Pancreatitis caused by methyldopa.

<p>Pancreatitis is a known serious complication among HIV infected patients. It has also been associated with didanosine therapy (&lt;1% of patients) and has been fatal in some cases. Didanosine should be used only with extreme caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Positive relationships have been found between the risk of pancreatitis and daily dose of didanosine. Whenever warranted by clinical conditions, didanosine should be suspended until the diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded by appropriate laboratory and imaging techniques. Similarly, when treatment with other medicinal products known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, didanosine should be suspended whenever possible. If concomitant therapy is unavoidable, close observation is warranted. Dose interruption should be considered when biochemical markers of pancreatitis have significantly increased, even in the absence of symptoms. Significant elevations of triglycerides are a known cause of pancreatitis and warrant close observation. <br /><em>Videx EC&#174; (didanosine) gastroresistant capsules, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Limited, updated February 2010</em></p></span>

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>Coadministration of nevirapine and didanosine (100-150 mg twice daily) increased didanosine AUC by 8% and decreased Cmax by 2%.

<p>Nevirapine may be administered with or without food, antacid or didanosine. Coadministration of nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200 mg twice daily for 2 weeks) with didanosine (100-150 mg twice daily) in 18 HIV+ patients caused no alteration in didanosine AUC or Cmax, Cmin was below the limits of detection for the assay. The effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. In a separate study in HIV-1 infected patients (n=6), nevirapine steady-state systemic exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered by didanosine, which is formulated with an alkaline buffering agent. <br /><em>Viramune Prescribing Information, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc, November 2011.</em></p>

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

<p>Oxytocin has a plasma half-life of about 1 to 6 minutes which is decreased in late pregnancy and during lactation. Following intravenous administration of oxytocin, uterine response occurs almost immediately and subsides within 1 hour. Following intramuscular injection of the drug, uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes and persists for 2 to 3 hours. Its rapid removal from plasma is accomplished largely by the kidney and the liver. Only small amounts are excreted in urine unchanged.<br /><em>Pitocin&#174; (Oxytocin Injection, USP, synthetic) US Prescribing Information, JHP Pharmaceuticals LLC, updated December 2007</em></p></span>

<p>Pancreatitis is a known serious complication among HIV infected patients. It has also been associated with didanosine therapy (&lt;1% of patients) and has been fatal in some cases. Didanosine should be used only with extreme caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Positive relationships have been found between the risk of pancreatitis and daily dose of didanosine. Whenever warranted by clinical conditions, didanosine should be suspended until the diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded by appropriate laboratory and imaging techniques. Similarly, when treatment with other medicinal products known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, didanosine should be suspended whenever possible. If concomitant therapy is unavoidable, close observation is warranted. Dose interruption should be considered when biochemical markers of pancreatitis have significantly increased, even in the absence of symptoms. Significant elevations of triglycerides are a known cause of pancreatitis and warrant close observation. <br /><em>Videx EC&#174; (didanosine) gastroresistant capsules, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Limited, updated February 2010</em></p></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction when pilocarpine is used either orally or as eye drops.

                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

                    <span>Praziquantel is metabolised via various cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, mainly CYP2B1 and CYP3A4, and therefore has the potential to interact with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of such enzymes. Enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin may decrease plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Conversely, enzyme inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and ketoconazole may increase plasma concentrations of praziquantel. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites which are thought to be inactive.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

<p>When the buffered formulation of ddI (375 mg single dose) was coadministered with ranitidine (150 mg single dose, 2 h before ddI) to 12 HIV-infected subjects, ddI AUC and Cmax increased by 14% and 13% respectively. Ranitidine AUC decreased by 16% and there was no change in Cmax. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between single doses of didanosine (375 mg, citrate buffered sachet) and ranitidine (150 mg) was studied in 12 HIV-infected subjects. When given in combination (ranitidine 2 h prior to didanosine), there was a statistically significant increase in didanosine AUC (from 2953 to 3359 ng.h/ml), but no effect on Cmax (1617 vs. 1825 ng/ml), half life or renal clearance. The AUC of ranitidine was statistically significantly reduced when given with didanosine (from 1771 to 1483 ng.h/ml), but there was no change in Cmax (325 vs. 333 ng/ml), half life or clearance. Coadministration does not result in a clinically significant interaction and the results suggest that a modification in the dose of didanosine or ranitidine is not necessary if ranitidine is dosed 2 h prior to didanosine. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic-interaction study of didanosine and ranitidine in patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.

<p>Riboflavin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Although riboflavin is widely distributed to body tissues little is stored in the body.

<p>When the buffered formulation of ddI (167 or 250 mg twice daily for 12 days) was coadministered with rifabutin (300 or 600 mg once daily for 12 days) to 11 HIV-negative subjects, ddI AUC and Cmax increased 13% and 17% respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The effect of didanosine buffered tablets (167-375 mg twice daily according to body weight) on the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin (300 mg once daily) was studied in 12 HIV-infected subjects. No statistically significant differences were seen in rifabutin pharmacokinetics for Cmax (525&#177;255 vs. 511&#177;341 ng/ml) or AUC (5023&#177;2780 vs. 5650&#177;4420 ng.h/ml; mean&#177;sd, alone vs. +ddI). Metabolism of rifabutin (as indicated by ratio of parent drug to 25-acetyl metabolite) was also unaltered. <br /><em>Rifabutin absorption in the gut unaltered by concomitant administration of didanosine in AIDS patients. Li RC, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1997, 41: 1566-1570. </em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of didanosine (167-375 mg twice daily) when administered alone or with rifabutin (300 or 600 mg once daily) were determined in 12 HIV-infected subjects. When given with rifabutin there were no statistically significant changes in didanosine Cmax (17% increase) or AUC (13% increase). Based on safety and pharmacokinetic assessments, rifabutin did not appear to interact with didanosine. <br /><em>A phase I evaluation of concomitant rifabutin and didanosine in symptomatic HIV-infected patients. Sahai J, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol, 1995, 9: 274-279. </em></p>
<p>Impaired absorption of rifabutin by concomitant administration of didanosine has been reported in a 45-year-old HIV-infected man treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, lamivudine and didanosine (400 mg daily). One month after starting levofloxacin and rifabutin (150 mg twice daily) for Mycobacterium xenopi spondylodiscitis, the patient had to be hospitalised because of microbiological failure. Rifabutin analysis showed undetectable concentrations. Drug history revealed that the patient had been taking didanosine only 30 min prior to the other drugs. Rifabutin analysis was repeated after administration of didanosine 3 h prior to rifabutin and showed quantifiable levels. <br /><em>Impaired absorption of rifabutin by concomitant administration of didanosine.

Interactions with the old formulation that were due to the presence of antacid should not apply to the new formulation. Timing of administration of Videx EC with other medications will still be dependent on food requirements, but no longer on gastric pH requirements. </em></p>
<p>When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) was coadministered with ritonavir (600 mg twice daily for 4 days) to 12 HIV-negative subjects, ddI AUC and Cmax decreased by 13% and 16% respectively. There was no change in the AUC or Cmax of ritonavir. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of didanosine (200 mg twice daily) given 2 hours prior to ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) decreased didanosine AUC by 13% and had no effect on Cmin. As ritonavir is recommended to be taken with food and didanosine should be taken on an empty stomach, dosing should be separated by 2.5 h. Dose alterations should not be necessary. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (600 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) with didanosine (200 mg every 12 hours for 4 days), in 12 subjects, caused no alteration in ritonavir AUC, Cmax or Cmin but decreased didanosine AUC and Cmax by 13% and 16%, respectively with no change in didanosine Cmin. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (600 mg every 12 h) and didanosine (200 mg every 12 h) to 12 HIV+ individuals found that the AUC and Cmax of didanosine were both reduced by ~15%. The relative small magnitude of change in ddI pharmacokinetics is of doubtful clinical significance and probably does not warrant an alteration in ddI dosage. However, dosing of ritonavir and ddI should be separated by 2.5 h to avoid formulation incompatibilities. Didanosine has little, if any, effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between ritonavir and didanosine when administered concurrently to HIV-positive patients.

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Pancreatitis has been described as a relatively common serious adverse effect of sodium stibogluconate therapy, and has also been associated with didanosine therapy (<1% of patients) and has been fatal in some cases.

<p>Pancreatitis is a known serious complication among HIV infected patients. It has also been associated with didanosine therapy (&lt;1% of patients) and has been fatal in some cases. Didanosine should be used only with extreme caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Positive relationships have been found between the risk of pancreatitis and daily dose of didanosine. Whenever warranted by clinical conditions, didanosine should be suspended until the diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded by appropriate laboratory and imaging techniques. Similarly, when treatment with other medicinal products known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, didanosine should be suspended whenever possible. If concomitant therapy is unavoidable, close observation is warranted. Dose interruption should be considered when biochemical markers of pancreatitis have significantly increased, even in the absence of symptoms. Significant elevations of triglycerides are a known cause of pancreatitis and warrant close observation. <br /><em>Videx EC&#174; (didanosine) gastroresistant capsules, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Limited, updated&nbsp; February 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Coadministration is not recommended. Fatal hepatic failure, as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in patients receiving didanosine and ribavirin with or without stavudine. Pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving didanosine in association with hydroxyurea and stavudine. Specific interaction studies have been conducted with stavudine without evidence of interaction. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of didanosine and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided. When the buffered formulation of ddI (100 mg twice daily for 4 days) was coadministered with stavudine (40 mg twice daily for 4 days) to 10 HIV-negative subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. When the same doses were studied in 10 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in stavudine AUC and a 17% increase in Cmax. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration is not recommended. Pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine. In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, e.g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet. <em>Zerit Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2011.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatmentexperienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and<br />close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. Patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided.. Coadministration of stavudine (40 mg twice daily for 4 days) and didanosine (100 mg twice daily for 4 days) was studied in 10 HIV-infected subjects. There was no change in stavudine AUC and a 17% increase in Cmax. Didanosine AUC and Cmax were unaltered. <br /><em>Zerit Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of single and coadministered doses of didanosine (100 mg) and stavudine (40 mg) were evaluated in 10 HIV-positive subjects. No significant changes in Cmax, AUC, elimination half life or renal clearance of didanosine and stavudine were observed when the drugs were administered simultaneously. Cmax and AUC values for didanosine (alone vs. combination) were 422&#177;184 vs. 419&#177;153 mg/ml and 615&#177;170 vs. 637&#177;155 ng/ml.h, respectively. Cmax and AUC values obtained for stavudine were 603&#177;160 vs. 726&#177;188 and 1246&#177;230 vs. 1326&#177;267 ng/ml.h, respectively. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of co-administered didanosine and stavudine in HIV-seropositive male patients.

It penetrates into the CSF within 4 hours of an oral dose to produce therapeutic concentrations, which may be more than half those in the blood. Up to 40% of sulfadiazine in the blood is present as the acetyl derivative. About 50% of a single dose of sulfadiazine given orally is excreted in the urine in 24 hours; 15 to 40% is excreted as the acetyl derivative. The urinary excretion of sulfadiazine and the acetyl derivative is dependent on pH. About 30% is excreted unchanged in both fast and slow acetylators when the urine is acidic whereas about 75% is excreted unchanged by slow acetylators when the urine is alkaline.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection. J Clin Pharmacol. 1986 Jan;26(1):22-6.</em></p>
<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

                    <span><p>Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. When didanosine gastro-resistant capsules were administered 2 hours prior to or concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the AUC for didanosine was on average increased by 48% and 60% respectively. The mean increase in the AUC of didanosine was 44% when the buffered tablets were administered 1 hour prior to tenofovir. In both cases the pharmacokinetic parameters for tenofovir administered with a light meal were unchanged. A reduced didanosine dose (250 mg) has been tested to avoid over-exposure to didanosine in case of co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but this has been associated with reports of high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage within several tested combinations. Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is therefore not recommended, especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4 cell count. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. If this combination is judged strictly necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for efficacy and didanosine related adverse events. <br />Triple NRTI Therapy:<br />There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage when didanosine was combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine as a once daily regimen. <br /><em>Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.</em></p>
<p>Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. A dose reduction of didanosine taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended. Administer didanosine 250 mg once daily to adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min and didanosine 200 mg once daily to adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. The appropriate dose of didanosine coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min has not been established. Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily with a light meal) and didanosine (400 mg single dose, 2 h before tenofovir) was studied in 26 HIV-negative subjects. AUC and Cmax of ddI both increased by 48%. Data from 25 subjects showed no change in the AUC and Cmax of tenofovir. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (400 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 25 HIV-negative subjects. AUC and Cmax of ddI increased by 60% and 64% respectively. There was no change in the AUC and Cmax of tenofovir. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (200 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 250 mg given alone under fasting conditions, AUC of ddI increased by 16% and Cmax decreased by 12%. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (250 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 400 mg given alone under fasting conditions, there was no change in the AUC of ddI and a 20% decrease in Cmax. <br />Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (325 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 400 mg given alone under fasting conditions, AUC of ddI increased by 13% and Cmax decreased by 11%.<br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>

<p><div>Coadministration of tenofovir-DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When administered with tenofovir-DF, Cmax and AUC of didanosine increased significantly. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir-DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. In patients weighing less than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 200 mg once daily when it is coadministered with tenofovir-DF. When coadministered, tenofovir-DF and didanosine EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). For additional information on coadministration of tenofovir-DF and didanosine, please refer to the full prescribing information for didanosine. When didanosine 250 mg enteric-coated capsules were administered with tenofovir-DF, systemic exposures of didanosine were similar to those seen with the 400 mg enteric-coated capsules alone under fasted conditions. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and buffered didanosine (250 or 400 mg once daily for 7 days, n=14) had no effect on tenofovir AUC, Cmax or Cmin. Coadministration of tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) and enteric-coated didanosine (250 mg simultaneously with tenofovir-DF and a light meal) decreased didanosine Cmax by 20% and had no effect on AUC when compared to values obtained with didanosine (400 mg) given alone under fasting conditions.<br /><em>Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Inc May 2015.</em></div><em></em></p>
<p>Intracellular concentrations of active phosphate metabolites were determined in three groups of HIV-infected subjects receiving didanosine alone (400 mg once daily, n=16), tenofovir (300 mg once daily, n=8) or didanosine/tenofovir (250/300 mg once daily, n =14). There were no significant differences in ddA-TP or TDF-DP when didanosine or tenofovir were administered alone or in combination. This study does not support the existence of a strong intracellular interaction between didanosine and tenofovir, but can not conclude that there is absolutely no interaction due to small sample size. As ddA-TP concentrations were similar when didanosine given alone (400 mg) or at a reduced dose (250 mg) with tenofovir, the study supports the dose adaptation proposed for this combination. <br /><em>Measurement of intracellular didanosine and tenofovir phosphorylated metabolites and possible interaction of the two drugs in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

                    <span>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

The sulfoxide form is predominant in plasma, with the parent compound and the sulfone metabolite having AUCs respectively of approximately 1% and 10% of that of the sulfoxide. The rapid biotransformation of triclabendazole in man and the previous findings in animals produced evidence of presystemic biotransformation including first-pass metabolism of triclabendazole. <br />In animals, the drug is largely excreted via the biliary tract in the faeces (90%), together with the sulfoxide and subsequently the sulfone metabolite.

<p>When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg single dose) was coadministered with trimethoprim (200 mg single dose) to 8 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC and a 17% increase in Cmax. Trimethoprim AUC increased 10% and Cmax decreased by 22%. When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg single dose) was coadministered with sulfamethoxazole (1000 mg single dose) to 8 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. Sulfamethoxazole AUC and Cmax decreased by 11% and 12% respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of didanosine (200 mg, buffered tablets), trimethoprim (200 mg) and sulfamethoxazole (1000 mg) were evaluated in 10 HIV-infected subjects as single agents and upon coadministration of single doses. The addition of didanosine to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resulted in a statistically significant decrease of 32% in renal clearance of trimethoprim and a statistically significant decrease of 8% in sulfamethoxazole AUC. There were no statistically significant effects of trimethoprim and/or sulfamethoxazole on the AUC or Cmax of didanosine. However, didanosine renal clearance decreased by 35% and percentage urinary recovery decreased by 16% when the three drugs were coadministered. These changes are no considered to be clinically relevant and dose modification is not required. <br /><em>A pharmacokinetic interaction study of didanosine coadministered with trimethoprim and/or sulphamethoxazole in HIV seropositive asymptomatic male patients.

<p>In the first 24 hours, about 75% of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration. Mean plasma clearance is about 0.058 L/kg/hr, and mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/hr. Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin. In anephric patients, the average half-life of elimination is 7.5 days. The distribution coefficient is from 0.3 to 0.43 L/kg.

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on limited data concerning the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profile of vercuronium, there is little potential for interaction with didanosine via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<p>When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg twice daily for 3 days) was coadministered with zidovudine (200 mg three times daily for 3 days) to 6 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. Zidovudine AUC and Cmax decreased by 10% and 17% respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) and didanosine (200 mg twice daily) was investigated in 6 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of zidovudine had no significant effect on didanosine pharmacokinetic parameters (&lt;12% difference in treatment means, p&gt;0.1). Coadministration of didanosine did not significantly alter zidovudine pharmacokinetic parameters, but did cause statistically significant increases in renal (18.5%) and apparent formation (30.5%) clearances of zidovudine glucuronide. These changes are unlikely to be clinically significant. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of simultaneously administered zidovudine and didanosine in HIV-seropositive male patients. Sahai J, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol, 1995, 10: 54-60. </em></p>
<p>The influence of didanosine on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine was investigated in 5 HIV-infected subjects. Addition of didanosine resulted in lower zidovudine levels in 4/5 subjects with an average decrease in zidovudine AUC of 14%. Didanosine pharmacokinetics were similar to historical data. The decrease in zidovudine exposure was not statistically significant and probably not clinically relevant. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction study of zidovudine and didanosine. Burger DM, et al. J Drug Dev, 1994, 6: 187-194. </em></p></span>
