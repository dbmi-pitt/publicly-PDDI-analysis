                    <span><p>Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant interactions between abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. <br /><em>Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2011.</em></p>
<p>Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase, 15 HIV-infected patients were enrolled in a crossover study evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. <br /><em>Ziagen Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, May 2012.</em></p>
<p>Multiple dose pharmacokinetics were determined in HIV-infected subjects following coadministration of abacavir (200, 400 or 600 mg three times daily or 300 mg twice daily) alone or with zidovudine (200 mg three times daily or 300 mg twice daily). Coadministration of zidovudine had only small and inconsistent effects on the steady state pharmacokinetics of abacavir that did not increase with dose. At the clinical abacavir dose (300 mg twice daily), zidovudine coadministration had no effect on abacavir AUC. The pharmacokinetic profiles of zidovudine in the absence of abacavir were not determined; however, mean AUC and Cmax values for zidovudine in the presence of abacavir were comparable to historical steady state values. <br /><em>Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abacavir alone and in combination with zidovudine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults. McDowell JA, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2000, 44:2061-2067. </em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics and safety of single doses of abacavir (600 mg), zidovudine (300 mg) and lamivudine (150 mg) were evaluated when given alone or with either or both of the other drugs to 13 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of abacavir with zidovudine (with or without lamivudine) decreased ZDV Cmax by ~20%, delayed ZDV Tmax by 0.5h and increased AUC of zidovudine glucuronide by up to 40%. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir when given alone, or with zidovudine or lamivudine, or with both zidovudine and lamivudine. <br /><em>Single dose pharmacokinetics and safety of abacavir (1592U98), zidovudine, and lamivudine administered alone and in combination in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

Adrenaline is rapidly inactivated in the body, mostly in the liver by the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). Much of a dose of adrenaline is excreted as metabolites in urine. The plasma half-life is about 2-3 minutes. However, when given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, local vasoconstriction may delay absorption so that the effects may last longer than the half-life suggests.<br /><em>Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Injection BP 1 in 1000 UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hameln pharmaceuticals ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

Two hours after the injection of alcuronium, partial recovery from the neuromuscular block had occurred from 100% to 26% +/- 24% depression of twitch tension, although less than 25% of the injected dose was recovered from the urine. The 12-h plasma concentration and urinary recovery were 0.1 +/- 0.08 mg/L and 61% +/- 20%, respectively. Recovery from neuromuscular block was dominated by intercompartmental distribution rather than by renal elimination. Alcuronium does not undergo biodegradation; apart from negligible biliary excretion, the kidney represented the only excretory pathway.<br /><em>Diefenbach C, K&#252;nzer T, Buzello W, Theisohn M.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

Metabolic turnover appears to be greater in females than males. Large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of the requirements of the body and after an intravenous dose, about 40% is excreted in 8 hours, which is increased to about 70% after tissue saturation. The amount of unchanged drug is dose dependent; in women the excretion of ascorbic acid appears to vary with the stage of the menstrual cycle and it is decreased when taking oral contraceptives.

                    <span><div>Zidovudine does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone. However, pharmacokinetic data have shown that atovaquone appears to decrease the rate of metabolism of zidovudine to its glucuronide metabolite (steady state AUC of zidovudine was increased by 33% and peak plasma concentration of the glucuronide was decreased by 19%). At zidovudine dosages of 500 or 600 mg/day it would seem unlikely that a three week, concomitant course of atovaquone for the treatment of acute PCP would result in an increased incidence of adverse reactions attributable to higher plasma concentrations of zidovudine. Extra care should be taken in monitoring patients receiving prolonged atovaquone therapy.<br><em>Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, January 2012.</em></div>

<p>Coadministration of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) and atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food) to 14 subjects resulted in a 31% increase in zidovudine AUC and no change in atovaquone AUC. Routine dose modification of zidovudine is not warranted with coadministration. <br><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, <em>ViiV Healthcare</em>, November 2011.</em></p>





<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between atovaquone (750 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) was studied in 14 HIV-infected subjects. Atovaquone significantly increased ZDV AUC (from 1.82 ± 0.62 to 2.39 ± 0.68 µg.h/ml); in contrast the AUC of ZDV-glucuronide was decreased from 7.31 ± 1.51 to 6.89 ± 1.42 µg.h/ml. Zidovudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone. The increase in ZDV AUC is unlikely to be of clinical concern; however, the interaction may be clinically significant in patients who are also receiving drugs that are toxic to the bone marrow (e.g. ganciclovir, amphotericin B, flucytosine). <br><em>Atovaquone inhibits the glucuronidation and increases the plasma concentrations of zidovudine.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. The most severe adverse effects associated with benznidazole are bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis. Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. If concomitant treatment with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters.</span>

<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

<p>The primary UGT enzymes responsible for chloramphenicol O-glucuronidation were evaluated in vitro. Reaction phenotyping for the glucuronidation of chloramphenicol with 12 expressed human liver UGT isoforms has identified UGT2B7 as having the highest activity for 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9. The formation of 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronide by pooled HLM and expressed UGT2B7 exhibited substrate inhibition kinetics with apparent K(m) values of 408.2 and 115.0 microM, respectively. Azidothymidine (AZT) and hyodeoxycholic acid (substrates of UGT2B7) inhibited 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation in pooled HLMs. In 10 donor HLM preparations, both chloramphenicol 3-O- and chloramphenicol 1-O-glucuronidation showed a significant correlation with AZT glucuronidation (UGT2B7) at 30 microM chloramphenicol. These results suggest that UGT2B7 is the primary human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoform catalyzing 3-O- and 1-O-chloramphenicol glucuronidation with minor contributions from UGT1A6 and UGT1A9.<br /><em>Identification of human UGT2B7 as the major isoform involved in the O-glucuronidation of chloramphenicol.

<p>An in vitro study screened the effect of 55 molecules, representative of 20 different therapeutic classes, on 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) glucuronidation by human liver microsomes. At high concentrations, chloramphenicol caused more than 90% inhibition of AZT glucuronidation, in vitro. For compounds that appeared to inhibit AZT glucuronidation, extrapolation to the clinical situation must take into account both the in vitro apparent Ki values and the usual expected plasma level for the coadministered drug. By considering these parameters, this work indicates that clinically relevant inhibition of AZT glucuronidation may be observed with chloramphenicol. Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies are required to validate these results.<br /><em>3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine drug interactions. Screening for inhibitors in human liver microsomes.

<p>A study examined the effect of a number of drugs which themselves undergo glucuronidation on AZT conjugation by human liver microsomes in vitro. Inhibitory effects were seen with chloramphenicol, with enzyme activity decreased by 88.7% at a concentration of 10 mM.

About 22% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.<br /><em>Piriton&#174; (Chlorphenamine) Tablets&nbsp; UK Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, updated May 2010</em></p>
<p>Eight healthy volunteers received a single 8mg oral dose of rac-chlorphenamine either given alone or following administration of quinidine 50mg every 6 h for 2 days prior to the study day and every 6 h thereafter until the end of the study. For (S)-(+)-chlorphenamine, administration of quinidine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in an increase in Cmax to 13.94 (P&lt;0.01), a reduction in CLoral to 0.22 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.01), and a prolongation of elimination half-life from 18.0 h to 29.3 h (P&lt;0.001). Administration of quinidine decreased CLoral for (R)-(-)-chlorphenamine to 0.60+/-0.10 l h-1 kg-1 (P&lt;0.005). In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, systemic exposure was greater after chlorphenamine alone than in extensive metabolizers, and administration of quinidine resulted in a slight increase in CLoral. Stereoselective elimination of chlorphenamine occurs in humans, with the most pharmacologically active (S)-(+)-enantiomer cleared more slowly than the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. CYP2D6 plays a role in the metabolism of chlorphenamine in humans.<br /><em>The roles of CYP2D6 and stereoselectivity in the clinical pharmacokinetics of chlorphenamine.

<div>Coadministration of zidovudine (500 mg twice daily) and various doses of clarithromycin (500-2000 mg twice daily) was studied in groups on HIV-infected subjects (n=4 per group). The simultaneous administration of zidovudine and clarithromycin had little impact on the pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin or of its major metabolite. Overall, clarithromycin significantly reduced ZDV Cmax by 41%, AUC (0-4h) by 25% and increased Tmax by 84%. Subgroup analyses of clarithromycin doses (500, 1000, 2000 mg) showed ZDV AUC decreased by 12%, 20% and 36% respectively. No statistically significant differences between the doses were noted due to the small number of subjects per group. The addition of clarithromycin did not appear to alter significantly the metabolism of zidovudine and no differences were noted in the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine glucuronide. <br /><em>Clarithromycin lowers plasma zidovudine levels in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

                    <span><p>Based on early studies with 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate, the drug was shown to be readily absorbed orally in humans and excreted principally in the feces. Cumulative urinary and fecal excretion of the 14C averaged about 50% of the oral dose and 37% of an intravenous dose after 5 days. Mean urinary excretion was approximately 8% with fecal excretion of about 42%.<br /><em>Clomid&#174; (clomiphene citrate tablets USP) US Prescribing Information, Sanofi-aventis U.S. revised June 2006</em></p>
<p>A study aimed to define the role of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the in vitro metabolism of enclomiphene, the more active isomer of clomiphene. Enclomiphene (25 microM) was incubated with human liver microsomes (from 4 extensive (EM) and 1 poor metaboliser with respect to CYP2D6) and with microsomes from lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP2D6. Microsomes from all the EM livers and recombinant CYP2D6 metabolised enclomiphene (the disappearance of drug ranged from 40-60%). No metabolism was detected in microsomes from the PM liver. Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene.

<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine.

<p>Actinomycin D (ActD) is a transcription inhibitor and has been used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. ActD has been reported to be a potential inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication due to its ability to inhibit reverse transcription. In contrast to what was expected, low concentrations of ActD (1 to 10 nM) upregulated HIV-1 replication 8- to 10-fold in MT-2 cells and had no effect on HIV-2 replication or on HIV-1 replication in MT-4, Jurkat, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The upregulation of HIV-1 replication was associated with an increase in HIV-1 transcription and a decrease in CD4 and CXCR4 expression. To further evaluate the effects of ActD on emergence of drug resistance in HIV-1 replication, a series of drug resistance assays were performed. Of interest, treatment of MT-2 cells with ActD also led to a high level of resistance to thymidine analogs (&gt;1,000-fold increase in resistance to zidovudine and &gt;250-fold to stavudine) but not to other nucleoside reverse transcriptases (RT), nonnucleoside RT, or protease inhibitors. This resistance appeared to be due to a suppression of host cell thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) expression. These results indicate that ActD leads to a novel form of thymidine analog resistance by suppressing host cell TK-1 expression. These results suggest that administration of combination drugs to HIV-1-infected patients may induce resistance to antiretroviral compounds via a modification of cellular factors.<br /><em>Actinomycin D induces high-level resistance to thymidine analogs in replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by interfering with host cell thymidine kinase expression.

<p>The effects of dapsone (100 mg once daily) and/or trimethoprim (200 mg twice daily) on single doses of zidovudine (200 mg ) were investigated in 8 HIV-infected subjects. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased renal clearance of zidovudine by 58%, with a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine. The combination effect of trimethoprim plus dapsone on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine was similar to effect of trimethoprim alone. <br /><em>Zidovudine, trimethoprim and dapsone pharmacokinetic interactions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. A clinical study reported that antiretroviral regimens containing zidovudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin. After administration of daunorubicin, myelosuppression can be expected in all patients. In patients treated with medicinal products influencing the bone marrow function (e. g. antiretroviral agents) the possibility of a marked disorder of hematopoiesis should be considered and the dose of daunorubicin should be modified if required. Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. If concomitant treatment with potentially myelosuppressive drugs is necessary,  care should be taken in monitoring haematological parameters.</span>

                    <span><p>After administration of a therapeutic dose of daunorubicin, myelosuppression will occur in all patients. Reversible bone marrow suppression develops dose-dependently and consists primarily of leukopenia, granulocytopenia (neutropenia) and thrombocytopenia. Anaemia occurs more rarely. Recovery generally occurs 2 to 3 weeks after the last injection. To avoid myelotoxic complications, careful monitoring of the blood count before and during treatment with special attention to the leukocytes, granulocytes, platelets and erythrocytes is necessary. Myelosuppression may require intensive supportive treatment. In patients treated with medicinal products influencing the bone marrow function (e. g. cytostatics, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, diphenylhydantoin, amidopyrine derivatives, antiretroviral agents) the possibility of a marked disorder of hematopoiesis should be borne in mind. The dose of daunorubicin hydrochloride should be modified if required.<br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em></p>
<p>The primary toxicity of DaunoXome is myelosuppression, especially of the granulocytic series, which may be severe, and associated with fever and may result in infection. Effects on the platelets and erythroid series are much less marked. Careful hematologic monitoring is required and since patients with HIV infection are immunocompromised, patients must be observed carefully for evidence of intercurrent or opportunistic infections.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) US Prescribing Information, Galen Limited, updated December 2011</em></p>
<div>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em>

<div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, or zidovudine). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<p>When the buffered formulation of ddI (200 mg twice daily for 3 days) was coadministered with zidovudine (200 mg three times daily for 3 days) to 6 HIV-infected subjects, there was no change in ddI AUC or Cmax. Zidovudine AUC and Cmax decreased by 10% and 17% respectively. <br /><em>Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) and didanosine (200 mg twice daily) was investigated in 6 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of zidovudine had no significant effect on didanosine pharmacokinetic parameters (&lt;12% difference in treatment means, p&gt;0.1). Coadministration of didanosine did not significantly alter zidovudine pharmacokinetic parameters, but did cause statistically significant increases in renal (18.5%) and apparent formation (30.5%) clearances of zidovudine glucuronide. These changes are unlikely to be clinically significant. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of simultaneously administered zidovudine and didanosine in HIV-seropositive male patients. Sahai J, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol, 1995, 10: 54-60. </em></p>
<p>The influence of didanosine on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine was investigated in 5 HIV-infected subjects. Addition of didanosine resulted in lower zidovudine levels in 4/5 subjects with an average decrease in zidovudine AUC of 14%. Didanosine pharmacokinetics were similar to historical data. The decrease in zidovudine exposure was not statistically significant and probably not clinically relevant. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction study of zidovudine and didanosine. Burger DM, et al.

It is widely distributed in tissues and is mainly excreted in the urine unchanged and as the N-oxide metabolite. Urinary excretion and hence plasma half-life is dependent on urinary pH. About 5% of a dose is eliminated in the faeces. Results in patients with chronic renal impairment and in healthy subjects, given a single 50-mg oral dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate, indicated that the plasma half-life of diethylcarbamazine is prolonged and its 24-hour urinary excretion considerably reduced in those with moderate and severe degrees of renal impairment<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

After absorption, diloxanide is very rapidly conjugated to form a glucuronide. In circulating blood, it is present to about 99% as a glucuronide and 1% as free diloxanide. Diloxanide is predominantly excreted in the urine. It is believed that the unabsorbed diloxanide is the active anti-amoebic substance, up to 10% remaining in the gut which is subsequently excreted as diloxanide in the faeces. No clinically-significant drug interactions are known<br /><em>Diloxanide Tablets 500mg UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Sovereign Medical, updated September 2007</em> </span>

About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals. There is little potential for dopamine to affect disposition of antiretrovirals, or to be affected if co-administered with antiretrovirals.</span>

                    <span>Orally administered dopamine is rapidly metabolised in the G.I. tract. Following IV administration, the onset of action of dopamine occurs within 5 minutes, and the drug has a duration of action of less than 10 minutes. Dopamine is metabolised in the liver, kidneys, and plasma by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals. Dopamine is excreted in urine principally as HVA and its sulphate and glucuroide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small fraction of a dose is excreted unchanged. <br /><em>Dopamine 40 mg/ml Sterile Concentrate UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hospira UK Ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Intravenous/oral eflornithine commonly causes myelosuppression that may lead to anaemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. If concomitant treatment with potentially myelosuppressive drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring haematological parameters. As less than 1% of topically applied eflornithine is systemically absorbed, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically relevant with topical preparations.</span>

<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

                    <span><p>Valproic acid, fluconazole or methadone when co-administered with zidovudine have been shown to increase the AUC with a corresponding decrease in its clearance. As only limited data are available the clinical significance of these findings is unclear but if zidovudine is used concurrently with either valproic acid, fluconazole or methadone, patients should be monitored closely for potential toxicity of zidovudine. <br /><em>Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) and fluconazole (400 mg once daily) to 12 subjects resulted in a 74% increase in zidovudine AUC. Routine dose modification of zidovudine is not warranted with coadministration. <br /><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>The effect of fluconazole (400 mg/day for 7 days) on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (500 mg) was determined in 10 HIV-infected subjects. Administration of fluconazole resulted in a significant increase in zidovudine half life (from 0.97&#177;0.17 to 1.11&#177; 0.14 h). No changes were found in the plasma kinetics of zidovudine glucuronide, nor in zidovudine or glucuronide urinary excretion. Treatment with zidovudine (250 mg 4 times daily for 14 days) did not have any impact on the half life of fluconazole when administered at a dose of 200 mg to 10 HIV-infected subjects. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction of fluconazole and zidovudine in HIV-positive patients. Brockmeyer NH, et al. Eur J Med Res, 1997, 2: 377-383. </em></p>
<p>The effect of fluconazole (400 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) was evaluated in 12 HIV-infected subjects. Fluconazole decreased the apparent oral clearance of zidovudine by 48% (p&lt;0.001), resulting in increases in zidovudine AUC (74% ), Cmax (84%) and half life (128%). Patients receiving this combination should be monitored for the development of zidovudine-related adverse reactions. <br /><em>Effect of fluconazole on zidovudine pharmacokinetics in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

<p>Coadministration of zidovudine (100 mg 5 times daily) and ganciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) was studied in 12 HIV-infected subjects.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Griseofulvin undergoes glucuronidation, although this is not the sole route of metabolism. There is little potential for interactions via competition of griseofulvin with zidovudine for glucuronidation pathways. In vitro studies using rat liver microsomes have shown that griseofulvin can inhibit glucuronidation of some substances, however the UGT isoforms affected are not known. Potentially levels of zidovudine could be increased by griseofulvin, however due to lack of data, the significance is unknown.</span>

<p>Eight toxic compounds of natural origin present in the human diet or used as drugs were tested as inhibitors of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity in rat liver microsomes with 1-naphthol (1-NA), phenolphthalein (PPh) and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) as substrates. Strong inhibitory effects were observed with the antifungal drug griseofulvin (GF): at a concentration of 1 mM, GF completely suppressed the glucuronidation of 1-NA and PPh, respectively. A concentration of 0.1 mM still proved to be highly inhibitory. The inhibition by GF was non-competitive with respect to PPh and was of a mixed type toward UDP-glucuronic acid, with apparent Ki values of 40 microM and 30 microM, respectively. GF did not act as a substrate for rat microsomal UGT.<br /><em>Grancharov K, Engelberg H, Naydenova Z, et al.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <span><p>Myelosuppression was dose related and dose limiting. It consisted mainly of leukopenia and, to a lesser extent, thrombocytopenia. A WBC count &lt;3000/&#956;L is expected in 50% of the patients treated with ifosfamide single agent at doses of 1.2 g/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days. At this dose level, thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;100,000/&#956;L) occurred in about 20% of the patients. At higher dosages, leukopenia was almost universal, and at total dosages of 10-12 g/m2/cycle, one half of the patients had a WBC count below 1000/&#956;L and 8% of patients had platelet counts less than 50,000/&#956;L. Myelosuppression was usually reversible and treatment can be given every 3 to 4 weeks. When ifosfamide is used in combination with other myelosuppressive agents, adjustments in dosing may be necessary. Anemia has been reported as part of postmarketing surveillance.<br /><em>Ifex&#174; (ifosfamide for injection) US Prescribing Information, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, updated July 2007</em></p>
<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>The bioavailabilities of a conventional and two slow release 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) formulations were compared after oral administration in a three way cross-over study in 8 male volunteers. In a further group of 6 male volunteers the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ISDN were investigated after intravenous infusion of a median dose of 14.1 mg for 2.5 h. The median elimination half-lives of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and IS-5-MN-2-Glu were 0.7, 5.1, 3.2 and 2.5 h, respectively. Apart from IS-5-MN-2-Glu, with a renal clearance of 5.9 l/min which suggested substantial glucuronidation in the kidney, the renal clearances of ISDN, IS-5-MN, IS-2-MN and the corresponding amounts excreted were negligible. 27.8% of the administered ISDN was excreted as IS-5-MN-2-Glu (8.7%) and IS (19.1%). Calculations based on the two mononitrate metabolites formed from ISDN showed an incomplete recovery of 84.1%, leading to the assumption that a simultaneous denitration to IS must have occurred. <br /><em>Abshagen U, Betzien G, Endele R et al.

Depending on the in vitro method used, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 were also shown to be involved in the metabolism of ivermectin but to a significantly lower extent compared to CYP3A4. The findings of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggest that clinically relevant concentrations of ivermectin do not significantly inhibit the metabolizing activities of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1.<br /><em>Stromectol&#174; US Prescribing Information, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme BV Issued May 2010</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Co-administration of zidovudine results in a 13% increase in zidovudine exposure (AUC) and a 28% increase in peak plasma levels. This is not considered to be of significance to patient safety and therefore no dosage adjustments are necessary. Zidovudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine.The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system. Zidovudine is not eliminated by this mechanism and are unlikely to interact with lamivudine. <br /><em>Epivir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2010.</em></p>
<p>No clinically significant alterations in lamivudine or zidovudine pharmacokinetics were observed in 12 asymptomatic HIV-infected adult patients given a single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) in combination with multiple doses of lamivudine (300 mg twice daily). <br /><em>Epivir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011. </em></p>
<p>A modest increase in Cmax (28%) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine, however overall exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered. Zidovudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine. <br /><em>Retrovir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK, Ltd, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of a single dose of zidovudine (200 mg) and lamivudine (300 mg every 12 hours) increased zidovudine AUC by 13% and had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine. Routine dose modification of zidovudine is not warranted. <br /><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011.</em></p></span>

                    <span>Levamisole is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations occur within 1.5 to 2 hours. It is extensively metabolised in the liver. The plasma half-life for levamisole is 3 to 4 hours and for the metabolites is 16 hours. It is excreted mainly in the urine as metabolites and a small proportion in the faeces. About 70% of a dose is excreted in the urine over 3 days, with about 5% as unchanged levamisole.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>Mannitol is metabolized only very slightly, if at all, to glycogen in the liver. The drug is freely filtered by the glomeruli, with less than 10% tubular reabsorption; it is not secreted by tubular cells. The elimination half-life in adults is about 100 minutes. Approximately 80% of a 100-g dose is excreted unchanged in urine within 3 hours. When large dose are given as in forced diuresis, retention of the drug may occur. In the presence of renal disease in which glomerular function is impaired or in conditions that impair small vessel circulation, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with ascitic accumulation, shock, or dehydration, mannitol clearance is lower than normal.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, December 2008</em></span>

When compared to data obtained from 15 HIV+ women not receiving antiretroviral therapy, there were no differences in medroxyprogesterone AUC, Cmin, half life or clearance. Side effects related to medroxyprogesterone were not increased. Thus, it is likely that this combination regimen would not decrease medroxyprogesterone&#8217;s contraceptive effectiveness.

Zidovudine plasma AUC increased by 14% in the presence of contraceptive steroid(s), but this was not statistically significant. The AUC of intracellular zidovudine triphosphate increased 19% following coadministration.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>The most consistent, dose-related toxicity is bone marrow suppression. This may be manifest by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Any of these findings may also reflect progression of the underlying disease. Since mercaptopurine may have a delayed effect, it is important to withdraw the medication temporarily at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in any of the formed elements of the blood. The dosage of mercaptopurine may need to be reduced when this agent is combined with other drugs whose primary or secondary toxicity is myelosuppression. Enhanced marrow suppression has been noted in some patients also receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.<br /><em>Purinethol&#174; (mercaptopurine) 50mg Tablets US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated November 2002</em></p>
<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

<p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for methadone and zidovudine alone and in combination were determined in 14 HIV-infected subjects. Concurrent administration of zidovudine (200 mg 5 times daily) did not alter methadone AUC or Cmax (n=9). Zidovudine parameters obtained in 9 subjects receiving methadone maintenance therapy (30-90 mg) were compared to those obtained in 5 subjects receiving zidovudine alone. Zidovudine concentrations were significantly higher in the methadone subjects with an average 43% increase in AUC observed. However, 5/9 subjects had zidovudine AUCs approximately 2-fold higher than control and 4/9 subjects had AUC which approximated to control values. While zidovudine has no effect on methadone maintenance, a subset of subjects had a significant increase in zidovudine exposure. The mechanism for this effect and its clinical consequences remain unclear. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions of zidovudine and methadone in intravenous drug-using patients with HIV infection.

<p>A study evaluated the efficacy and the tolerance of the combination zidovudine + methotrexate in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Twenty-nine patients (22 men and 7 women), either newly diagnosed or pretreated, were included. Histologic diagnoses were mainly Burkitt (27%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (45%). The treatment plan included three weekly courses of methotrexate at 1 g/m2 (days 1, 8, and 15) plus oral zidovudine at 2 g/m2 (days 1, 2, and 3), 4 g/m2 (days 8, 9, and 10), and 6 g/m2 (days 15, 16, and 17), plus leucovorin rescue. From the eleventh patient on, in case of complete or partial remission, the treatment was continued with three additional courses, using zidovudine at the maximum dose. Grade III-IV neutropenia and anemia were observed in 52% and 31% of the courses, respectively. The authors conclude that zidovudine + methotrexate is an effective and well-tolerated regimen in HIV-related NHL.<br><em>3'-Azido 3'-deoxythymidine + methotrexate as a novel antineoplastic combination in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

<p>31 patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or hepatocellular carcinoma were treated with weekly oral methotrexate (7.5 mg/M2 every 6 hours for 6 doses) and continuous oral zidovudine (200mg four times daily). Patients were treated for a total of 6 months or until disease progression. The median age was 66 (range 44-79) and the median KPS was 80. No patient had received prior chemotherapy. Hematologic toxicity was severe with 50% of patients developing hemoglobins less than 8 gm/dl and 70% with granulocyte counts less than 1000 per mm3. One patient achieved a radiographic complete remission and 2 had stable disease. Two-thirds of patients progressed within 2 months of beginning therapy.

                    <span>In vitro studies have shown that interactions between miltefosine and drugs which are metabolised by cytochrome P450, glucuronidated or otherwise conjugated are unlikely, however the possibility of interactions with commonly used drugs can not be totally excluded. No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form. The most likely excreted products are choline and choline-containing products.<br /><em>Impavido&#174; (Miltefosine) Capsules German Product Information, Paladin Labs Ltd, updated September 2009</em> </span>

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

<p>Naproxen (250 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine when studied in 6 HIV+ subjects stable on zidovudine (200 or 250 mg).

                    <span><p>Neostigmine undergoes hydrolysis by cholinesterase and is also metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

It is rapidly and extensively metabolised and relatively low concentrations of nifurtimox appear in the plasma and tissues. It is presumed to cross the blood-brain barrier.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                    <span><p>A potential interaction between zidovudine and paracetamol was reported in a 43-year old HIV-infected male who had chronic use of paracetamol (500 mg every 4 hours) prior to starting zidovudine therapy. Paracetamol and zidovudine pharmacokinetics were determined on several occasions and show extremely rapid absorption of both drugs (10-15 min for paracetamol, 15-20 min for zidovudine) with relatively high Cmax values. The patient was treated with one third of the standard zidovudine dose for that time (100 mg four times daily) and no toxicity or opportunistic infections developed of the next 8 months of follow up. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics of zidovudine and acetaminophen in a patient on chronic acetaminophen therapy. Burger DM, et al. Ann Pharmacother, 1994, 28: 327-330. </em></p>
<p>Coadministration of zidovudine (1000-1200 mg/day) and paracetamol (500 mg every 6 h) was studied in 6 HIV-infected subjects and did not result in a significant change in any pharmacokinetic parameter of zidovudine or zidovudine glucuronide. Paracetamol pharmacokinetics were comparable to historical values. <br /><em>Short-term, combined use of paracetamol and zidovudine does not alter the pharmacokinetics of either drug. Burger DM, et al. Neth J Med, 1994, 44: 161-165.</em></p>
<p>The effect of various doses of paracetamol (325 mg for 3 days, n=13; 650 mg for 3 days, n=8; 650 mg for 7 days, n=6) on the clearance of zidovudine (200 mg every 4 hours) was studied in HIV-infected subjects. Clearance of zidovudine increased by 5%, 11% and 33% with the three doses studied, resulting in lower serum concentrations of zidovudine. <br /><em>Acetaminophen does not impair clearance of zidovudine.

<p>Serum zidovudine and zidovudine glucuronide concentrations were determined in HIV-infected subjects taking regular doses of zidovudine with and without paracetamol.

<p>Phenytoin plasma levels have been reported to be low in some patients receiving zidovudine, while in one case a high level was documented. However, in a pharmacokinetic interaction study in which 12 HIV-1-positive volunteers received a single 300-mg phenytoin dose alone and during steady-state zidovudine conditions (200 mg every 4 hours), no change in phenytoin kinetics was observed. Although not designed to optimally assess the effect of phenytoin on zidovudine kinetics, a 30% decrease in oral zidovudine clearance was observed with phenytoin. <br /><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011.</em></p>
<p>Serum phenytoin concentrations were investigated in 109 samples from 21 patients with AIDS and in 1231 samples 557 control subjects. Total phenytoin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with AIDS (8.8&#177;0.7 vs. 10.6&#177;0.2 mg/L), although phenytoin doses were significantly higher. Zidovudine did not influence phenytoin levels. <br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of phenytoin in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Burger DM, et al.

<div>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver. In vitro metabolic experiments with accompanying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that recombinant CYP4F2 (Supersomes) and human liver microsomes supplemented with NADPH converted vitamin K1 to a single product. A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

                    <span>Praziquantel is metabolised via various cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, mainly CYP2B1 and CYP3A4, and therefore has the potential to interact with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of such enzymes. Enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin may decrease plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Conversely, enzyme inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, and ketoconazole may increase plasma concentrations of praziquantel. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites which are thought to be inactive.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

Agranulocytosis typically occurs within the first 3 months of therapy. Patients should be instructed to immediately report any symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis, such as fever or sore throat. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia (pancytopenia) may also occur. Propylthiouracil should be discontinued if agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia (pancytopenia), ANCA-positive vasculitis, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, fever, or exfoliative dermatitis is suspected, and the patient's bone marrow indices should be obtained.<br /><em>Propylthiouracil tablets US Prescribing Information, DAVA Pharmaceuticals Inc. updated February 2010</em></p>
<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia.

<div>Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine 472 (n = 18), stavudine (n = 10), or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, exacerbation of anemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the HIV regimen. Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in established combination HIV-1/HCV therapy, especially in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anemia. Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh &gt;6). <br /><em>Retrovir Prescribing Information, ViiV Healthcare, November 2011.</em></div>
<p>The effect of ribavirin (800 mg/day) on the plasma and intracellular PK of zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine was studied HIV/HCV co-infected subjects receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine, or stavudine plus lamivudine. Plasma zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine and intracellular drug and endogenous triphosphates were measured at baseline without ribavirin and after 8-12 weeks of ribavirin co-administration. Plasma results showed no impact of ribavirin on nucleoside concentrations and ribavirin levels were consistent with previous data measured in the absence of the three NRTIs. Similar findings were observed for the deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine triphosphate analogues, when given with or without ribavirin, suggesting that ribavirin does not perturb the intracellular metabolism of zidovudine, lamivudine or stavudine. <br /><em>Effect of ribavirin on intracellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection: final results of a randomized clinical study.

<p>The effect of rifampicin (600 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) was studied in 8 HIV-infected subjects. Rifampicin induced zidovudine glucuronidation and amination pathways resulting in decreased plasma and urine exposures to zidovudine.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs there is little potential for interaction. Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolised, likely by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase.

                    <span>Sodium nitroprusside is rapidly metabolized, probably by interaction with sulfhydryl groups in the erythrocytes and tissues. Cyanogen (cyanide radical) is produced which is converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase). This mitochondrial enzyme normally is present in excess quantities such that the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cyanogen to thiocyanate usually is the availability of sulfur donors (e.g., thiosulfate, cystine, cysteine). Sodium nitroprusside is excreted entirely as metabolites, principally thiocyanate. In animals, sodium nitroprusside metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, exhaled air, and probably in feces. The elimination half-life of thiocyanate is 2.7&#8211;7 days when renal function is normal but is longer in patients with impaired renal function or hyponatremia.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em> </span>

<p>The efficacy and toxicity of sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at a dosage of 20 mg/(kg.d) for either 20 days (for cutaneous disease) or 28 days (for visceral, mucosal, or viscerotropic disease) in the treatment of leishmaniasis was studied in 96 U.S. Department of Defense health care beneficiaries with parasitologically confirmed leishmaniasis, prospectively followed for 1 year. One patient was infected with human immunodeficiency virus; otherwise, comorbidity was absent. Adverse effects were common and necessitated interruption of treatment in 28% of cases, but they were generally reversible. These included arthralgias and myalgias (58%), pancreatitis (97%), transaminitis (67%), headache (22%), hematologic suppression (44%), and rash (9%). <br /><em>Safety and efficacy of intravenous sodium stibogluconate in the treatment of leishmaniasis: recent U.S. military experience.

<p>Adverse events were recorded in a study comparing sodium stibogluconate treatment with local heat therapy. Patients with parasitologically confirmed L. major infection were randomized to receive intravenous sodium stibogluconate (SSG) 20mg/kg/day for ten doses or localized ThermoMed (TM) device heat treatment (applied at 50&#176;C for 30 seconds) in one session. Reversible abdominal pain/pancreatitis, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, fatigue, mild cytopenias, and elevated transaminases were more commonly present in the SSG treated participants.<br /><em>A randomized controlled trial of local heat therapy versus intravenous sodium stibogluconate for the treatment of cutaneous Leishmania major infection.

<p>Anaemia, neutropenia and leucopenia (usually secondary to neutropenia) can be expected to occur in patients receiving zidovudine. Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine. If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012<br /></em></p></span>

<p>Zidovudine and stavudine are phosphorylated by the cellular enzyme (thymidine kinase), which preferentially phosphorylates zidovudine, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active triphosphate form. Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine. <br /><em>Zerit Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, March 2011.</em></p>
<p>Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. <br /><em>Zerit Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, January 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of adding stavudine (40 mg twice daily, n=35) to existing zidovudine therapy (300 mg twice daily) was studied in HIV-infected subjects and compared to those receiving stavudine monotherapy (40 mg twice daily, n=37). The most important finding in this study was that the combination of d4T and ZDV was inferior to d4T alone, with subjects receiving the combination showing progressive declines in CD4 cell counts over 16 weeks. Pharmacological antagonism between d4T and ZDV was the most likely mechanism. Intracellular d4T triphosphate concentrations were determined in 4 subjects receiving d4T alone and 2 subjects receiving d4T+ ZDV and were found to be lower when given in combination (65 vs. 10 fmol/10^6 cells). <br /><em>In vivo antagonism with zidovudine plus stavudine combination therapy.

If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.<br /><em>Retrovir&#174; (zidovudine) 250mg Capsules UK Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, updated February 2012</em></p></span>

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.</span>

After telaprevir was discontinued, the hemoglobin values increased to the mean level in the control group and remained similar to control levels thereafter.<br /><em>Telaprevir with peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection.

                    <span>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

<p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Coadministration has not been studied. Topotecan undergoes both hepatic and renal elimination. Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. However caution is recommended if coadministered due to the potential additive haematological toxicity.</span>

                    <span><p>In vivo, triclabendazole is rapidly oxidised into its sulfoxide metabolite, which is further oxidised to the sulfone metabolite. The sulfoxide form is predominant in plasma, with the parent compound and the sulfone metabolite having AUCs respectively of approximately 1% and 10% of that of the sulfoxide. The rapid biotransformation of triclabendazole in man and the previous findings in animals produced evidence of presystemic biotransformation including first-pass metabolism of triclabendazole. In animals, the drug is largely excreted via the biliary tract in the faeces (90%), together with the sulfoxide and subsequently the sulfone metabolite.

If concomitant therapy with any of these drugs is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.

<p>The effect of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg, twice daily, three times weekly) on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (250 mg twice daily) was studied in 16 HIV-infected subjects. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine or zidovudine glucuronide when administered alone or with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. <br /><em>Absence of effect of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole on pharmacokinetics of zidovudine in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

<p>The effects of dapsone (100 mg once daily) and/or trimethoprim (200 mg twice daily) on single doses of zidovudine (200 mg ) were investigated in 8 HIV-infected subjects. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased renal clearance of zidovudine by 58%, with a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine. The combination effect of trimethoprim plus dapsone on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine was similar to effect of trimethoprim alone. <br /><em>Zidovudine, trimethoprim and dapsone pharmacokinetic interactions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.

Metabolic clearance of zidovudine was not affected by TMP or TMP/SMX.

ZDV concentration in cerebrospinal fluid increased from 27 ng/ml to 47 ng/ml. <br /><em>Valproic acid increases cerebrospinal fluid zidovudine levels in a patient with AIDS. Akula SK, et al.

<p>Coadministration of zidovudine and valproate was studied at steady stated in 6 HIV-infected subjects. In the presence of valproate, zidovudine AUC increased 2-fold, with a corresponding decline in oral clearance. There was no significant increase in the plasma half life of zidovudine. The mean zidovudine glucuronide to zidovudine urinary excretion ratio was reduced by more than 50% and the amount of unconjugated zidovudine recovered in the urine increased by more than 2-fold. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interaction between zidovudine and valproic acid in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, April 2007.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations.

Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>
