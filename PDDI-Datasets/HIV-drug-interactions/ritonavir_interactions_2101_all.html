                      <span>In vitro studies suggest that albendazole is predominantly metabolised by CYP450 enzymes, including CYP3A4. In a clinical study in 8 healthy volunteers, steady state ritonavir (200 mg twice daily) decreased albendazole and the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide AUC (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively).

                    <span><p>Ritonavir, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have the potential to reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of albendazole; albendazole sulfoxide. The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but may result in decreased efficacy, especially in the treatment of systemic helminth infections. Patients should be monitored for efficacy and may require alternative dose regimens or therapies.<br /><em>Eskazole&#174; Australian Product Information, GlaxoSmithKline Updated September 2010</em></p>
<div>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 400mg albendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. Pharmacokinetic parameters of albendazole and&nbsp; its metabolite albendazole sulfoxide, were not changed by short-term administration of ritonavir. However long-term administration resulted in significant changes in albendazole disposition, with a significant decrease in albendazole and albendazole sulfoxide AUC0-24 (73% and 59% respectively) and Cmax (74% and 48% respectively). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

<div>The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of albendazole were determined in vitro. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to albendazole sulfoxide production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in albendazole sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced albendazole sulfoxide in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more albendazole sulfoxide than those expressing CYP1A2. Production of albendazole sulfoxide in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.<br /><em>Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes.

Coadministration with ritonavir (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) decreased alprazolam AUC by 12% and Cmin by 16%. Alprazolam metabolism was inhibited following the introduction of ritonavir. After ritonavir use for 10 days, no inhibitory effect of ritonavir was observed. Caution is warranted during the first several days when alprazolam is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, before induction of alprazolam metabolism develops. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days) with a single dose of alprazolam, in 12 subjects caused a 12% and 16% decrease in alprazolam AUC and Cmax, respectively. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Following coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg 12 hourly) and a single dose of alprazolam (1 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers, it was found that alprazolam AUC was reduced by 12% and alprazolam Cmax was reduced by 16% in the presence of ritonavir. Ritonavir AUC was in the expected range. Modification of the alprazolam dose in patients receiving ritonavir is unnecessary. Contraindication of alprazolam and ritonavir is unwarranted. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam Frye R, Bertz R, Granneman GR, et al. 37th International Conference on Antimicrobial Agents &amp; Chemotherapy, 1997, abstract A-59.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg 12 hourly, 4 doses) and alprazolam (1 mg single dose) was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers. Coadministration of ritonavir produced a highly significant prolongation of alprazolam elimination half-life, an increase in AUC and a 41% decrease in clearance. The findings emphasise the complex time dependent consequences of ritonavir co-treatment on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam. Therapeutic guidance contained in the product labelling should reflect these complexities rather than simply allowing or prohibiting specific drug combinations.<br /><em>Alprazolam-ritonavir interaction: implications for product labelling.

<p>Ampicillin is metabolised to some extent to penicilloic acid which is excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion; it is reduced by probenecid. About 20 to 40% of an oral dose may be excreted unchanged in the urine in 6 hours; urinary concentrations have ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL after a dose of 500 mg. After parenteral use about 60 to 80% is excreted in the urine within 6 hours.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

                    <span>In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively. The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.<br /><em>Abilify Summary of Product Characteristics, Otsuka/Bristol-Myers Squibb, November 2012.</em> </span>

Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinemia) and therefore is not recommended. Only when atazanavir with ritonavir is co-administered with efavirenz, a dose increase of ritonavir to 200mg once daily could be considered. In this instance, close clinical monitoring is warranted. Refer to the Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics for further details. Coadministration of atazanavir (300 mg once daily) and ritonavir (100 mg once daily) increased atazanavir AUC by 86% and Cmin by 11-fold. Based on cross-study comparison to atazanavir alone (400 mg once daily), atazanavir AUC increased 2-fold and Cmin increased 3-7 fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of atazanavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of 300 mg atazanavir once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in treatment experienced patients. Ritonavir has been shown to cause modest asymptomatic prolongation of the PR interval in some healthy adult subjects. Rare reports of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing conduction system abnormalities or in patients receiving medicinal products known to prolong the PR interval (such as atazanavir) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir. Norvir should be used with caution in such patients. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of atazanavir and ritonavir, atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased. Atazanavir plamsa concentrations achieved with atazanavir 300 mg qd and ritonavir 100 mg qd are higher than those achieved with atazanavir 400 mg qd. See the complete Prescribing Information for atazanavir for details on co-administration of atazanavir 300 mg qd with ritonavir 100 mg qd. The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended. Patients should consult their physician if they experience symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, abnormal heart rhythm, or loss of consciousness. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg once daily has not been clinically evaluated. The use of higher ritonavir doses might alter the safety profile of atazanavir (cardiac effects, hyperbilirubinaemia) and therefore is not recommended. Ritonavir 100 mg once daily is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics. In a combined analysis, atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg (n=33, HIV+) was compared to atazanavir 400 mg without ritonavir (n=28). Atazanavir AUC increased by 250%, Cmax increased by 120% and Cmin increased by 713%. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and ritonavir is CYP3A4 inhibition. <br /><em>Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, <em>April 2014</em>.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg once daily) with atazanavir (300 mg once daily) increased the atazanavir Cmax, AUC, and Cmin by 1.86, 3.38 and 11.89-fold, respectively. If atazanavir is coadministered with ritonavir, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg once daily be given with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food. <br /><em>Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, September 2015.</em></p></span>

Although statistically significant, the authors state that the 2-fold increase in AUC of the active metabolite seen with ritonavir would be clinically inconsequential and in HIV-infected patients receiving a PI and requiring an inhaled corticosteroid, inhaled beclomethasone is preferable to fluticasone. Moreover, these data show that PK results from drug interaction studies using ritonavir alone do not always predict the magnitude of interaction when ritonavir is co-administered with another PI. <br /><em>Co-administration of orally inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and HIV protease inhibitor does not significantly alter adrenal function in healthy volunteers.

This increase is likely due to ritonavir and increases in bedaquiline exposure would be expected when coadministered with other ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors. The combination of bedaquiline and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used systemically for more than 14 consecutive days should be avoided. If coadministration is necessary, clinical monitoring including frequent electrocardiogram assessment and monitoring of transaminases is recommended.

Because of previous  bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery  uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using  dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1%  eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to  have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no  peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular  necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked  suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of  less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration  of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, &gt;570 nmol/L).  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of  adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid  features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure  to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and  atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), while  continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was  added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over  the following year, the patient&#8217;s weight declined, with marked  improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples  revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7  nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease  inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses  of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal  axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between  discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of  adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in  the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was  responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical  ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and  Cushing&#8217;s syndrome.<br /><em>Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and adrenal axis  suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye  drops.

<div>Coadministration of bosentan (125 mg twice daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) alone or in combination for 9.5 days was investigated in a three-way crossover study in 12 HIV-negative subjects. Bosentan did not affect lopinavir and ritonavir AUC to a clinically relevant extent (decreases of 14% and 17%, respectively) and there was no significant change in Cmax for either drug. The pharmacokinetics of bosentan were strongly affected by coadministration: bosentan concentrations increased up to 48-fold during the first 4 days of coadministration. At steady state, bosentan AUC and Cmax increased by 5.22-fold and 6.12-fold, respectively. The increased exposure to bosentan was reflected in an increase in adverse events attributed to bosentan, that is, mainly headache, but not in liver enzyme abnormalities. It is anticipated that all ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors will have a similar effect on bosentan pharmacokinetics. <br /><em>Mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between bosentan and lopinavir/ritonavir in healthy participants.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Bupivacaine is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir may increase levels of bupivacaine.

                    <span><p>Bupivacaine is extensively metabolised in the liver, predominately by aromatic hydroxylation to 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine and N-dealkylation to PPX, both mediated by cytochrome P4503A4. About 1% of bupivacaine is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 h and approximately 5% as PPX. The plasma concentrations of PPX and 4-hydroxy-bupivacaine during and after continuous administration of bupivacaine are low as compared to the parent drug. <br /><em>Marcain&#174; Polyamp Steripack 0.25% and 0.5% UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AstraZeneca UK Limited, updated May 2012</em></p>
<div>A crossover studied evaluated seven healthy volunteers given itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo, once daily for 4 days. On day 4, racemic bupivacaine 0.3 mg kg-1 was given i.v. over 60 min and venous plasma samples were collected for 23 h. Plasma concentrations of R- and S-bupivacaine, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of R-bupivacaine by 21% (P &lt; 0.05) and that of S-bupivacaine by 25% (P &lt; 0.05), while it had no significant effect on other pharmacokinetic variables of the enantiomers. Reduction of bupivacaine clearance by itraconazole probably increases the steady-state concentration of bupivacaine enantiomers by 20-25%. This should be taken into account in the concomitant use of bupivacaine and itraconazole, although the interaction seems to be of limited clinical significance.<br /><em>Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine enantiomers in healthy volunteers.

<div>Ritonavir was noted to be extensively metabolised by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, primarily by the CYP3A isozyme family and to a lesser extent by the CYP2D6 isoform.Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 &gt; CYP2D6. Co-administration of Norvir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects.<br /><em>Norvir&#174; (ritonavir) 100mg film-coated tablets, UK Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Limited, updated September 2012</em></div></div></span>

Coadministration of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) decreased bupropion AUC by 66% and Cmin by 62%. Bupropion is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6. Concurrent administration of bupropion with repeated doses of ritonavir is expected to decrease bupropion levels. These effects are thought to represent induction of bupropion metabolism. However, because ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. In contrast to long-term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant interaction with bupropion after short-term administration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reductions in bupropion concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of ritonavir co-administration. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012</em>

<p>The effect of ritonavir (200 mg, 4 doses) on a single dose of bupropion (75 mg) was investigated in 7 HIV-negative males. The effect on bupropion exposure was inconsistent and highly variable (20 &#177; 20% increase in AUC, 31 &#177; 21% increase in Cmax, mean &#177; SE). The only statistically significant changes in PK parameters of bupropion and metabolites were a 14% decrease in threohydrobupropion AUC and an increase in Tmax for erythrohydrobupropion from 2.6 to 5.2 h. These findings indicate that short-term ritonavir dosing has only a minimal impact on a single dose of bupropion; however, further studies are required using multiple doses over a longer period. <em>Ritonavir has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetic disposition of a single dose of bupropion administered to human volunteers.

<p>Bupropion metabolism is mediated primarily by CYP2B6 and in vitro data has pointed to nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz being inhibitors of this enzyme. There is therefore potential for a drug interaction. This report is a case series aimed at documenting the clinical consequence of the co-administration of bupropion with nelfinavir, ritonavir, and efavirenz. The median duration of concomitant use was 8 months and ranged from 3 weeks to 2 years. There were no episodes of seizures documented in any of the medical records for patients who took bupropion with the CYP2B6 inhibitors. However, these data should be regarded as highly preliminary since: there is a low rate of seizure incidence in the literature, There were no PK measurements which are vital if we are to understand this interaction and no patients were receiving ritonavir at a dose above 100 mg bd. Further data are therefore required. <br /><em>Concurrent use of bupropion with CYP2B6 inhibitors, nelfinavir, ritonavir and efavirenz: a case series. Park-Wyllie LY &amp; Antoniou T.

<p>The hydroxylation of bupropion was studied <em>in vitro</em> using human liver microsomes. It was concluded that ritonavir, efavirenz and nelfinavir inhibited CYP2B6 and therefore bupropion hydroxylation. The IC50 for ritonavir was 2.2 &#181;M. This suggests that there is the potential for clinical drug interactions.<br /><em>Ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro: Potential drug interactions with bupropion.

<p>There is a case report of carbamazepine toxicity in a patient after starting a ritonavir- and efavirenz-containing antiretroviral regimen. Prior to starting ritonavir (400 mg bd) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily), the patient was stable on carbamazepine 600 mg/day, with carbamazepine concentrations of 6.9 &#181;g/ml (therapeutic range 4&#8211;12 &#181;g/ml). Four days after starting the ART regimen, the patient was hospitalised with a one day history of worsening ataxia resulting in two falls; serum carbamazepine concentrations were found to be 20.4 &#181;g/ml. Carbamazepine was discontinued for 9 days and restarted at 300 mg/day, however, over the next 3 weeks it was necessary to further reduce the carbamazepine dose to 100 mg/day. The patient remained stable on this dose for approximately 2 weeks, when it became necessary to discontinue her ART regimen. Following the withdrawal of ritonavir and efavirenz, it was found that carbamazepine concentrations were subtherapeutic requiring an increase in carbamazepine dose back to the original 600 mg/day. The authors had not expected a marked increase in carbamazepine concentrations as the change in the ART regimen involved changing from indinavir to ritonavir (a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor), but at the same time adding in a relatively potent inducer of CYP3A4 (efavirenz). <br /><em>Carbamazepine toxicity after starting combination antiretroviral therapy including ritonavir and efavirenz.

<p>There is a case report of a 36 year old man who developed carbamazepine toxicity. The subject had been stable for nearly 2 years on antiepileptic medication (phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine 400 mg three times daily) and an antiretroviral regimen of stavudine, lamivudine and indinavir. The antiretrovirals were then changed to saquinavir (400 mg bd), ritonavir (400 mg bd) and nevirapine (200 mg od). Two days after changing regimens, the subject presented to the emergency department with vertigo, drowsiness, disorientation, diplopia and severe ataxia. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine were found to have increased by 99.4% reaching 16.6 mg/L (previous value 8.3, therapeutic range 4-12). The phenytoin concentrations had dropped by 33% and the Phenobarbital concentration remained unchanged. Carbamazepine was reduced to 200 mg three times daily, ritonavir stopped and nelfinavir 1000 mg twice daily started. There were no changes to doses of phenobarbital, phenytoin, saquinavir or nevirapine (other than standard dose escalation to 200 mg bd). Two days after these changes carbamazepine concentrations returned to the therapeutic range and the symptoms of toxicity disappeared.<br /><em>Ritonavir-induced carbamazepine toxicity.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

<p>Approximately 80% to 90% of an IM or IV dose of ceftazidime is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 24-hour period. After the IV administration of single 500-mg or 1-g doses, approximately 50% of the dose appeared in the urine in the first 2 hours. An additional 20% was excreted between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, and approximately another 12% of the dose appeared in the urine between 4 and 8 hours later. The calculated plasma clearance of approximately 115 mL/min indicated nearly complete elimination of ceftazidime by the renal route. Administration of probenecid before dosing had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime, suggesting that ceftazidime is eliminated by glomerular filtration and is not actively secreted by renal tubular mechanisms.<br /><em>Fortaz&#174; (ceftazidime for injection) US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, updated August 2010</em></p></span>

The AUC and Cmin of 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite were decreased by 100% and 99%, respectively. Due to the large therapeutic window of clarithromycin no dose reduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal function. Clarithromycin doses greater than 1 g per day should not be co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. For patients with renal impairment, a clarithromycin dose reduction should be considered: for patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 50%, for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min the dose should be reduced by 75%. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg every 8 hours for 4 days) with clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours for 4 days) was investigated in 22 subjects. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were increased by 12%,15% and 14%, respectively. Clarithromycin AUC and Cmax were increased by 77% and 31%, respectively, whilst Cmin increased 2.8-fold. The 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite AUC, Cmax and Cmin were reduced by 100%, 99% and 100%, respectively. No dose adjustment for patients with normal renal function is necessary. For patients with renal impairment the following dosage adjustments should be considered: i) for patients with creatinine clearance 30-60 ml/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%; ii) for patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%.<br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg every 8 h) and clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 h) was studied in 22 subjects. There was a 77% increase in clarithromycin AUC and a 100% decrease in 14-OH clarithromycin AUC. There was a 31% increase in clarithromycin Cmax and a 99% decrease in 14-OH clarithromycin Cmax.

Quinidine (1 microM) completely inhibited the metabolism of enclomiphene by all the EM livers and by recombinant CYP2D6 (p&lt;0.001, one way ANOVA). Ketoconazole (2 microM) had no significant effect on enclomiphene metabolism in 3 out of the 4 EM livers. The extent of enclomiphene metabolism was correlated with the amount of CYP2D6 present (p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation test). The findings indicate that CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of enclomiphene.<br /><em>CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for the metabolism of clomiphene. Ghobadi C, Gregory A, Crewe HK, Rostami-Hodjegan A, Lennard MS. Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 2008;23(2):101-5.</em></p>
<p>A study investigated clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. The CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors was correlated with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed the in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. The results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. The data provide evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.<br /><em>Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites.

The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir.

Inactivation (minor, 10%) to the neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde metabolite is performed mainly by CYP3A4. In vivo data indicate that ritonavir induces CYP2B6. In theory, ritonavir could potentially reduce the risk of neurotoxicity and increase the amount of drug available for the activation pathway which may increase the efficacy and the toxicity of cyclophosphamide.

                    <span><div>Darunavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses:<br />Darunavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment (ART) experienced patients. <br />Darunavir 800 mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily may be used in some ART experienced patients. (Refer to the darunavir SmPC for further information on once daily dosing in ART experienced patients.)<br />Darunavir 800mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily in ART-na&#239;ve patients.</div>
<div>Coadministration of darunavir (600 mg single dose) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased darunavir AUC by 14-fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of darunavir as a result of CYP3A inhibition. Darunavir must be given with ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect. Ritonavir doses higher than 100 mg twice daily have not been studied with darunavir. For further information, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Prezista. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></div>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of ritonavir, darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased. See the complete Prescribing Information for darunavir for details on co-administration of darunavir 600 mg bid with ritonavir 100 mg bid. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Darunavir must always be given orally with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Increasing the dose of ritonavir did not significantly affect darunavir concentrations and is not recommended. The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily Therefore, darunavir must only be used in combination with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. <br /><em>Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>Darunavir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A, thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of darunavir. When a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily, there was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir. Therefore, darunavir should only be used in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir to achieve sufficient exposures of darunavir. <br /><em>Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, June 2012.</em></p></span>

                      <span>A clinical study reported that ritonavir had no effect on daunorubicin (liposomal) pharmacokinetics. An in vitro study has shown that daunorubicin was able to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, but was unlikely to cause clinically significant drug interactions via this mechanism. There is therefore little potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of daunorubicin treatment and may include dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities. Caution is required if prescribing ritonavir with medicines known to prolong the PR interval.</span>

                    <span><div>A study investigated the pharmacokinetics of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) administered alone or in combination with antiviral therapy including protease inhibitors (PI) to HIV-positive patients affected by Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Patients with extensive or rapidly progressing AIDS-related KS (n=18) received DaunoXome at a dose of 40mg/m2 alone or with triple combination therapy consisting of one PI plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Daunorubicin pharmacokinetics were determined in a total of 23 cycles, 6 with DaunoXome alone, 9 in combination with indinavir, 6 with ritonavir and 2 with saquinavir. Plasma samples were obtained at different times during the 72 h after DaunoXome administration. Daunorubicin and daunorubicinol plasma levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of daunorubicin in patients receiving DaunoXome in combination with indinavir and ritonavir compared with those in patients not receiving PIs. Therefore in patients affected by AIDS-related KS treated with Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) there is no pharmacokinetic justification for reducing the doses of DaunoXome<br /><em>The pharmacokinetics of liposomal encapsulated daunorubicin are not modified by HAART in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.

<div>Protease Inhibitors and Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors are known inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 IIIA (CYP-3A) and may also have a role in the inhibition of the drug transporting protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Daunorubicin and other anthracyclines may undergo some metabolism by CYP-3A and are known substrates of P-gp. There is therefore a theoretical possibility of interaction between DaunoXome and these two groups of antiviral therapy. To date however, a single study has indicated that there is no effect of PI&#8217;s or NNRTI&#8217;s on DaunoXome&#8217;s pharmacokinetic properties. Limited data from one small study where patients were treated with and without protease inhibitors indicate that there were no major changes in DaunoXome associated toxicity.<br /><em>DaunoXome&#174; Injection (liposomal daunorubicin) UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Galen Ltd, updated October 2011</em></div>

<div>An in vitro study determined CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Daunorubicin hydrochloride showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 value for the 2 microsome sample was 206/200 micromol/l. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, potential for daunorubicin to cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4 was thought to be relatively low. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<div>Damage to the myocardium is one of the major risks of treatment with daunorubicin hydrochloride and may include: dose-independent supraventricular arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, AV-block) and/or non-specific ECG abnormalities (ST-T wave changes, low voltage QRS complex, T waves). Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, endomyocardial fibrosis, pericarditis/myocarditis have also been reported. Careful monitoring of cardiac function before, during and after treatment is therefore recommended in order to identify the risk of cardiac complications as early as possible. Risk factors for cardiac toxicity include active or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/ pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of drugs with the ability to suppress cardiac contractility; or cardiotoxic drugs.<br /><em>Daunorubicin 20mg Powder for Injection UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Zentiva, updated March 2012</em>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Desogestrel is a prodrug that requires activation to etonogestrel. Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration is predicted to increase the conversion to the active metabolite etonogestrel due to inhibition of CYP3A4. When used in a combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced.

<div>A case reports describes a 51-year-old woman with HIV who presented with weight gain and a 1-month history of right hip pain.&nbsp; Her ART included tenofovir (300 mg once daily), emtricitabine (200 mg once daily), and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily). Because of previous bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis, complicated by immune recovery uveitis with severe, chronic, cystoid macular oedema, she was also using dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops six times daily, and betamethasone 0.1% eye ointment at night, in both eyes. On examination, she was noted to have central adiposity and enlargement of the dorsocervical fat, but no peripheral lipoatrophy. An MRI scan of the hip showed avascular necrosis. A tetracosactide (Synacthen) stimulation test showed marked suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, with a baseline cortisol of less than 25 nmol/L rising to only 37 nmol/l 30 min after administration of tetracosactide 250mg (normal response at 30 min, &gt;570 nmol/L). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was undetectable. The presence of adrenal axis suppression with low ACTH, in the context of Cushingoid features and avascular necrosis of the hip, suggested ongoing exposure to high systemic levels of exogenous corticosteroids. Ritonavir and atazanavir were substituted with efavirenz (600 mg once daily), while continuing the steroid eye drops. Oral hydrocortisone 15 mg daily was added to avoid precipitating crisis due to adrenal insufficiency. Over the following year, the patient&#8217;s weight declined, with marked improvement in her adrenal function. Analysis of stored serum samples revealed elevated levels of dexamethasone at presentation (1.4-1.7 nmol/L) which fell dramatically after discontinuation of protease inhibitor therapy (undetectable to 0.181 nmol/L). Although prior courses of oral and intravenous corticosteroids may have contributed to adrenal axis suppression, the close temporal correlation between discontinuation of ritonavir, reversal of weight gain and recovery of adrenal function, combined with detectable levels of dexamethasone in the blood, strongly suggests that co-administration of ritonavir was responsible for the accumulation of excessive systemic levels of topical ocular corticosteroids, resulting in adrenal axis suppression and Cushing&#8217;s syndrome.<br /><em>Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and adrenal axis suppression in a patient treated with ritonavir and corticosteroid eye drops.

<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (600 mg every 12 h) and didanosine (200 mg every 12 h) to 12 HIV+ individuals found that the AUC and Cmax of didanosine were both reduced by ~15%. The relative small magnitude of change in ddI pharmacokinetics is of doubtful clinical significance and probably does not warrant an alteration in ddI dosage.

In patients who are already taking ritonavir when digoxin is introduced, digoxin should be introduced more gradually than usual.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of digoxin were determined in 12 healthy volunteers following a single dose of digoxin (0.4 mg orally) before and after 14 days of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily). Ritonavir increased digoxin AUC(0-72) from 26.20 &#177; 8.67 to 31.96 &#177; 11.24 ng.h/mL and AUC(0-8) from 6.25 &#177; 1.8 to 8.04 &#177; 2.22 ng.h/mL. Digoxin oral clearance decreased from 149 &#177; 101 to 105 &#177; 57 mL/h.kg. Other digoxin pharmacokinetics, including renal clearance, were unaffected by ritonavir. Overall, 75% (9/12) of subjects had higher concentrations of digoxin after ritonavir administration. The most likely mechanism for this interaction is ritonavir-associated inhibition of P-gp. <br /><em>Ritonavir decreases the nonrenal clearance of digoxin in healthy volunteers with known MDR1 genotypes.

Patients should consult their physician if they experience symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, abnormal heart rhythm, or loss of consciousness. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>Docetaxel should be administered with caution in patients concomitantly receiving potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals). A drug interaction study performed in patients receiving ketoconazole and docetaxel showed that the clearance of docetaxel was reduced by half by ketoconazole, probably because the metabolism of docetaxel involves CYP3A4 as a major (single) metabolic pathway. Reduced tolerance of docetaxel may occur, even at lower doses. <br /><em>Taxotere (docetaxel) Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-Aventis, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Three cases have been reported where administration of IV docetaxel to HIV+ patients on ritonavir-containing regimens resulted in severe haematological and cutaneous toxicity 3-7 days after the first infusion of docetaxel (70-100 mg/m2), despite patients having normal baseline liver function and blood cell counts. Each patient recovered following the withdrawal of docetaxel. <br /><em>Severe toxicity related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and ritonavir in HIV-infected patients. Mir O, Dessard-Diana B, Louet AL, et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2010, 69(1): 99-101.</em></p>
<p>A study was carried out in 12 patients with solid tumours. One cohort of patients (n=4) received 10 mg of oral docetaxel and a subsequent cohort (n=8) 100 mg of oral docetaxel, coadministered with 100 mg oral ritonavir randomized to simultaneous administration or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel on days 1 and 8. On day 15 or 22, patients received 100 mg i.v. docetaxel. Docetaxel AUC in patients who received 10 mg oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was low, and the dose could safely be increased to 100 mg. The AUC in patients who received 100 mg oral docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was 2.4 &#177; 1.5 and 2.8 &#177; 1.4 mg/L.h, respectively, compared with 1.9 &#177; 0.4 mg/L.h after i.v. docetaxel. The apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel combined with ritonavir simultaneously or ritonavir given 60 minutes before docetaxel was &gt;100% (i.e. 131 &#177; 90% and 161 &#177; 91%, respectively), indicating marked inhibition by ritonavir of gut wall and/or hepatic metabolism. Coadministration of ritonavir significantly enhanced the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel and caution is essential when giving docetaxel with boosted PIs. <br /><em>Coadministration of ritonavir strongly enhances the apparent oral bioavailability of docetaxel in patients with solid tumors.

Hewish M, Miller R, Forster M, Smith I. J Med Case Reports, 2009, 3: 8866.</em></p>
<p>A 40 year old HIV patient on a lopinavir/ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen was commenced on docetaxel-containing chemotherapy (25 mg/m2 IV weekly). Eight days after the first infusion he developed neutropaenic fever; the docetaxel was discontinued and the antiretroviral regimen was unchanged. The authors postulate that ritonavir may have decreased docetaxel clearance through inhibition of CYP3A4, resulting in acute docetaxel toxicity. <br /><em>Possible pharmacokinetic interaction involving ritonavir and docetaxel in a patient with Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma.

                    <span>Orally administered dopamine is rapidly metabolised in the G.I. tract. Following IV administration, the onset of action of dopamine occurs within 5 minutes, and the drug has a duration of action of less than 10 minutes. Dopamine is metabolised in the liver, kidneys, and plasma by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase to the inactive compounds homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. About 25% of a dose of dopamine is metabolised to norepinephrine within the adrenergic nerve terminals. Dopamine is excreted in urine principally as HVA and its sulphate and glucuroide conjugates and as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. A very small fraction of a dose is excreted unchanged. <br /><em>Dopamine 40 mg/ml Sterile Concentrate UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Hospira UK Ltd, updated August 2010</em></span>

Further inhibition of 5-alpha reductase at increased dutasteride exposure, is not likely. However, a reduction of the dutasteride dosing frequency can be considered if side effects are noted. It should be noted that in the case of enzyme inhibition, the long half-life may be further prolonged and it can take more than 6 months of concurrent therapy before a new steady state is reached. <br /><em>Avodart Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK Ltd, January 2006.</em></p>

It is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and also a substrate of the renal transporter OAT3 and the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The net effect of this interaction is difficult to predict as ritonavir may reduce empagliflozin exposure due to induction of UGT2B7 but may also increase empagliflozin exposure due to inhibition of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. Monitor the effect and adjust empagliflozin dosage as required.

                    <span><p>No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. In an in vivo human metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). In separate pharmacokinetic interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP34A inducer) did not result in clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.<br /><em>Fuzeon Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2008.</em></p>
<p>Results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that enfuvirtide is unlikely to have significant drug interactions with concomitantly administered drugs metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. No drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications have been identified that would warrant alteration of either the enfuvirtide dose or the dose of the other antiretroviral medication. Coadministration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 4 days) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects results in increases in enfuvirtide Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 24%, 22% and 14% respectively. Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily for 4 days with 1000 mg saquinavir) and enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily) to 12 HIV+ subjects results in no change in enfuvirtide Cmax, and increases in enfuvirtide AUC and Cmin of 14% and 26% respectively. <br /><em>Fuzeon Prescribing Information, Roche Laboratories Inc, June 2007.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of enfuvirtide (90 mg twice daily, sc) with either ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, n=12) or saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily, n=12) was investigated in HIV+ patients. Although bioequivalence criteria were not met for coadministration of enfuvirtide with and without ritonavir, the increase in enfuvirtide AUC, Cmax and Cmin were small (22, 24 and 14%, respectively) and not clinically relevant. When administered with ritonavir-boosted saquinavir there was a 14, 7 and 25% increase in AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively and bioequivalence criteria were met for AUC and Cmax. Thus, no dosage adjustments are warranted when enfuvirtide is coadministered with low-dose ritonavir or low-dose ritonavir-boosted saquinavir. <br /><em>Lack of interaction between enfuvirtide and ritonavir or ritonavir-boosted saquinavir in HIV-infected patients.

<p>Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases active towards a wide range of xenobiotics. ethionamide (ETA) is a pro-drug requiring bioactivation to exert toxicity. M. tuberculosis possesses a flavin monooxygenase (EtaA) that oxygenates ETA first to the sulfoxide and then to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably through a second oxygenation involving sulfinic acid. ETA is also a substrate for mammalian flavincontaining monooxygenases (FMOs). A study examined activity of expressed human and mouse FMOs toward ETA, as well as liver and lung microsomes. All FMOs converted ETA to the S-oxide (ETASO), the first step in bioactivation. Co-incubations with the general CYP and FMO inhibitors SKF-525A and thiourea, suggest that ETA S-oxygenation in mouse liver and lung microsomes is predominantly, FMO-mediated.<br /><em>Metabolism of the anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide by mouse and human FMO1, FMO2 and FMO3 and mouse and human lung microsomes.

<p>Fluphenazine is metabolised by P450 2D6 and is itself an inhibitor of this drug metabolising enzyme. The plasma concentrations and the effects of fluphenazine may therefore be increased and prolonged by drugs that are either the substrates or inhibitors of this P450 isoform, possibly resulting in severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias or CNS side effects.The effects of phenothiazines on the heart are dose-related. ECG changes with prolongation of the QT interval and T-Wave changes have been reported commonly in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have also occurred after overdosage. Sudden, unexpected and unexplained deaths have been reported in hospitalised psychotic patients receiving phenothiazines. The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.

<p>Two cases in 66 year old HIV+ men have been reported of an interaction with fluticasone and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). The first case had been receiving fluticasone for 12 months prior to presentation and indinavir/ritonavir for 4 months prior to presentation. A good recovery was made with i.v. gamma globulin and the initial fluticasone dose of 500 µg twice daily was halved. The second case had been receiving fluticasone for 12 months prior to presentation and amprenavir/ritonavir for 6 months prior to presentation. Budesonide/efomoterol was substituted for fluticasone and his Cushingoid features gradually improved over 6-12 months. However, ~1 year later he presented with a fractured neck of the femur; investigations revealed avascular necrosis, osteoporosis and a subnormal cortisol level. A possible cause maybe the augmentation of budesonide concentrations by ritonavir. <br><em>Exogenous glucocorticoid excess as a result of ritonavir-fluticasone interaction.

<p>Amprenavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: amprenavir 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Coadministration of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 64% and Cmin by 5-fold, based on cross-study comparison to amprenavir alone (1200 mg twice daily). Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of 600 mg amprenavir twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Ritonavir <strong>oral solution</strong> should not be co-administered with amprenavir <strong>oral solution</strong> to children due to the risk of toxicity from excipients in the two formulations. Coadministration of fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased amprenavir AUC by 2.4-fold and Cmin by 11-fold. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of amprenavir (from fosamprenavir) as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Fosamprenavir must be given with ritonavir to ensure its therapeutic effect. Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of fosamprenavir 700 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir in doses greater than 100 mg twice daily has not been clinically evaluated.

<p>A retrospective observational study looked at APV trough concentrations in HIV+ subjects receiving FPV (1400 mg once daily) with RTV (100 or 200 mg once daily).

<p>The effect of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily, n=11) or fosamprenavir (700 mg twice daily, n=15) was investigated in HIV-negative subjects. Ritonavir increased plasma amprenavir exposure to a similar extent when coadministered with either amprenavir or fosamprenavir. Geometric least square mean ratios for AUC, Cmax and Cmin (alone vs with ritonavir) for amprenavir were 3.16, 1.27 and 10.73 respectively, and for fosamprenavir were 3.40, 1.51 and 12.68 respectively, When given with ritonavir, amprenavir mean AUC increased from 8.21 to 26.2 &#181;g.h/ml, Cmax from 3.66 to 4.69 &#181;g/ml and Cmin from 0.12 to 1.32 &#181;g/ml. Increases observed when fosamprenavir was coadministered with ritonavir were AUC increasing from 9.51 to 33.2 &#181;g.h/ml, Cmax increasing from 3.19 to 4.92 &#181;g/ml and Cmin increasing from 0.14 to 1.77 &#181;g/ml. <br /><em>Ritonavir increases plasma amprenavir (APV) exposure to a similar extent when coadministered with either fosamprenavir or APV.

<p>The pharmacokinetics of fosamprenavir (1400 mg once daily) with ritonavir (100 mg or 200 mg once daily) were investigated in 36 healthy subjects. Amprenavir Cmin was 38% lower when administered with 100 mg ritonavir than with 200 mg ritonavir (GM 0.86 vs 1.40 &#181;g/ml); however, it remained ~6-fold higher than the protein-binding adjusted IC50 for WT HIV (0.146 &#181;g/ml). Amprenavir Cmax and AUC were also lower with 100 mg ritonavir (Cmax 7.93 vs 8.17 &#181;g/ml; AUC 66.4 vs 73.8 &#181;g/ml.h). The lower dose of ritonavir provided tolerability advantages to the 200 mg dose and achieved equivalent amprenavir Cmax and AUC. <br /><em>Plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics and safety following coadministration of fosamprenavir with a reduced ritonavir dose once daily (COL 10053).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir following standard doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) or high doses of fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg) were investigated in healthy subjects (13 per group). When compared to the standard dose, fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg produced increases in amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC of 26%, 81% and 54% respectively; ritonavir Cmin decreased by 11% and Cmax and AUC increased by 71% and 49% respectively. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/200 mg) resulted in increases in amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC of 32%, 48% and 26%. The regimen where only fosamprenavir was increased (i.e. 1400/100 mg) achieved the highest plasma amprenavir exposure. In contrast, the regimen where both fosamprenavir and ritonavir were increased (i.e. 1400/200 mg) was associated with the highest incidence of ALT and AST elevations and is not recommended. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluation of high dose combinations of fosamprenavir and ritonavir (APV10028).

<p>The pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and ritonavir were assessed in healthy volunteers and it was found that amprenavir (450, 750 or 1200 mg twice daily) appeared to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir (200 or 400 mg twice daily). Ritonavir improved the pharmacokinetic profile of amprenavir with all three regimens (400R/450A, 400R/750A, 200R/1200A) yielding higher AUC and Cmin than amprenavir alone (1200 mg twice daily).<br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir and amprenavir in healthy volunteers.

<p>The effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir was studied in 14 HIV+ subjects receiving amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) and 15 HIV+ subjects receiving amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Cmin for amprenavir alone ranged from 20&#8211;3022 ng/ml and for amprenavir + ritonavir from 115&#8211;4848 ng/ml. The combination appeared to be potent, safe and useful for compliance.<br /><em>Therapeutic drug monitoring of amprenavir combined with ritonavir as salvage therapy in HIV-1 infected patients.

The mean amprenavir Cmin concentration was 58 ng/ml in the alone group and 1320 ng/ml when given with ritonavir.<br /><em>Amprenavir inhibitory quotient and virological response in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients on an amprenavir-containing salvage regimen without or with ritonavir.

<p>The safety and pharmacokinetic kinetic interaction between amprenavir and ritonavir was studied in healthy volunteers. Amprenavir was dosed twice daily at 450 or 900 mg alone and with 100 or 300 mg ritonavir. Relative to amprenavir alone, ritonavir coadministration resulted in 3.3-4 fold increase in amprenavir AUC and a 10.8-14.2 fold increase in amprenavir Cmin. The two ritonavir doses had similar effects on amprenavir, but adverse events were more frequent with the higher dose. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetics and safety of amprenavir and ritonavir following multiple-dose, coadministration to healthy volunteers.

<p>The pharmacokinetic of amprenavir (1200 mg) and ritonavir (200) when given once daily) were studied in 8 HIV-infected subjects from 2 to 48 weeks of treatment. Plasma amprenavir concentrations were maintained over the 48 weeks with geometric mean values for AUC, Cmax and Cmin being 54.6 vs 56.1 &#181;g/ml.h, 6.86 vs 7.21 &#181;g/ml, 1.42 vs 1.21 &#181;g/ml (week 2 vs week 48 respectively). <br /><em>An assessment of plasma amprenavir pharmacokinetics following long term administration of Agenerase and low dose ritonavir QD in HIV-infected adult subjects (APV20001 and COL30500).

<p><strong>Amprenavir + Efavirenz + Ritonavir</strong></p>
<p>This study, ACTG5043, was developed when the routine use of boosted protease inhibitors was not considered standard of care, and the optimal approach to combining PIs with efavirenz was under investigation. ACTG5043 had a relatively complex design and examined PK interactions between amprenavir and efavirenz, both by themselves and when nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir was added. A PK study was conducted after the administration of single doses of amprenavir (600 mg, day 0). Subjects (n=56) received efavirenz (600 mg once daily) for 10 days and restarted amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with efavirenz for days 11 to 13 with a PK study on day 14. A second PI (nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily; indinavir 1200 mg twice daily; ritonavir 100 mg twice daily; or saquinavir 1600 mg twice daily) was added to amprenavir and efavirenz on day 15, and a PK study was conducted on day 21. Controls continued amprenavir and efavirenz without a second PI. Amprenavir AUC was 46-61% lower with efavirenz (day 14 vs day 0; P values of &lt;0.05). In the nelfinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir groups, day 21 amprenavir AUCs with efavirenz were higher than AUCs for efavirenz alone. The authors conclude that efavirenz lowered amprenavir AUC, but NFV, IDV or RTV compensated for efavirenz induction. <br /><em>Amprenavir and efavirenz pharmacokinetics before and after the addition of nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir in seronegative individuals.

<p>The timing of the amprenavir-efavirenz interaction and the effect of adding ritonavir were evaluated in seven HIV+ individuals receiving amprenavir (1200 mg twice daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). In one patient efavirenz had no effect on amprenavir. The remaining individuals showed a decrease in amprenavir concentrations as early as day 7. The addition of low dose ritonavir reversed the effect of efavirenz on amprenavir concentrations.<br /><em>Efavirenz-induced decrease in plasma amprenavir levels in human immunodeficiency virus infected patients and correction by ritonavir.

<p>Ritonavir oral solution contains alcohol (43 % v/v), ie up to 2572.5 mg per maximum dose of 600 mg, equivalent to 81 ml beer (4%), 23 ml wine (14%) per dose. Each 100 mg dose contains up to 428.8 mg alcohol and each 200 mg dose contains 857.5 mg alcohol.

                    <span><p>After intravenous or subcutaneous injection heparin is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The half-life of heparin depends on its dose and route as well as the method of calculation and is subject to wide inter- and intra-individual variation; a range of 1 to 6 hours with an average of 1.5 hours has been cited. It may be slightly prolonged in renal impairment, decreased in patients with pulmonary embolism, and either increased or decreased in patients with liver disorders. Heparin is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. It is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites, although after large doses up to 50% may be excreted unchanged.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-11-15</em></p>
<p>Heparin is not eliminated enzymatically nor by glomerular filtration or renal tubular secretion. In all likelihood, the anticoagulant is transferred to reticuloendothelial cells, which may also provide the means for its degradation.<br /><em>Estes JW. Clinical pharmacokinetics of heparin. Clin Pharmacokinet 1980; 5: 204&#8211;20.</em></p>
<p>After either subcutaneous or intravenous injection heparin is distributed primarily within the intravascular space. A short distribution phase is seen which is thought to correspond to endothelial cell binding and internalisation. The disposition curve for unfractionated heparin has a unique concave-convex shape which is the result of combined saturable and nonsaturable elimination mechanisms. The nonsaturable elimination mechanism is renal and is the primary route of elimination for low molecular weight heparins.<br /><em>Kandrotas RJ. Heparin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. When used illicitly, heroin is mainly injected or inhaled through the nose and goes directly in the bloodstream. Heroin is then rapidly deacetylated to 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and subsequently to morphine by plasma and liver esterases, respectively. 6-MAM (the first metabolite to appear in vivo) has been shown to enter the brain at a much faster rate (35 times faster) than morphine where it binds to mu opioid receptors. 6-MAM was shown to correlate with the acute effects of heroin. Ritonavir is unlikely to alter 6-MAM concentrations but may alter morphine concentrations. Morphine is mainly glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1) and, to a lesser extent, to the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (UGT2B7>UGT1A1). As ritonavir induces glucuronidation, coadministration could potentially decrease morphine concentration but facilitate the formation of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide are substrates of P-gp and coadministration may potentiate the effects of opiate in the CNS (via inhibition of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier). Monitor for sign of opiate toxicity.</span>

<p>Previous studies showed that several drugs inhibited quinine 3-hydroxylation, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated reaction, in vitro. In this extended study, 13 drugs were selected and tested by human liver microsomes in order to further determine their respective inhibition constant (Ki) and type of inhibition. According to the apparent Ki values, the inhibitory rank order of these tested drugs was as follows: ketoconazole &gt; doxycycline &gt; omeprazole &gt; tetracycline &gt; troleandomycin (with pre-incubation) &gt; primaquine &gt; troleandomycin (without pre-incubation) &gt; nifedipine &gt; erythromycin &gt; verapamil &gt; oleandomycin &gt; diltiazem &gt; cimetidine &gt; hydralazine. Among these drugs, doxycycline, tetracycline, ketoconazole, nifedipine and hydralazine were judged as mixed inhibitors; whereas, the remaining other drugs tested were judged as competitive inhibitors. When the plasma/serum concentrations possibly attained after their usual therapeutic doses were taken into account, tetracycline, doxycycline, omeprazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, troleandomycin and erythromycin are likely to be inhibitors of quinine metabolism in patients when these drugs are co-administrated with quinine.<br /><em>Zhao XJ, Ishizaki T.

<p>An in vitro study reports a method using cryopreserved human hepatocytes and the time-dependent aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitor hydralazine (K(I) = 83 &#177; 27 &#956;M, k(inact) = 0.063 &#177; 0.007 min(-1)), which estimates the contribution of AO metabolism relative to total hepatic clearance. Using zaleplon as a probe substrate and simultaneously monitoring the AO-catalyzed formation of oxozaleplon and the CYP3A-catalyzed formation of desethyzaleplon in the presence of a range of hydralazine concentrations, it was determined that &gt;90% inhibition of the AO activity with minimal effect on the CYP3A activity could be achieved with 25 to 50 &#956;M hydralazine. Differences in estimated f(m(AO)) between two batches of pooled human hepatocytes suggest that sensitivity to hydralazine varies slightly with hepatocyte preparations. Substrates with a CYP2D6 contribution to clearance were affected by hydralazine to a minor extent, because of weak inhibition of this enzyme. <br /><em>Strelevitz TJ, Orozco CC, Obach RS.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of ifosfamide to both inhibit and induce CYP3A4. Clinical data with sunitinib suggests that ifosfamide can decrease sunitinib levels via CYP3A4 induction. There is potential for ifosfamide to alter levels of ritonavir via modulation of CYP3A4 activity. Ifosfamide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Data with ketoconazole show that enzyme inhibitors such as ritonavir may inhibit ifosfamide conversion to active metabolites, therefore decreasing its therapeutic effect.</span>

                    <span><p>The pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide exhibit considerable interindividual variation. It is a prodrug that is extensively metabolised, chiefly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes such as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in the liver, to both active and inactive metabolites; there is some evidence that metabolism is saturated at very high doses. Although licensed product information states that a mean terminal elimination half-life is about 15 hours after a single high-dose intravenous bolus, most studies at lower doses recorded elimination half-lives of 4 to 8 hours. After repeated doses there is a decrease in the elimination half-life, apparently due to autoinduction of metabolism. It is excreted largely in urine, as unchanged drug and metabolites. <br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference.

<p>In patients (n=32) with advanced solid tumours, continuous once daily sunitinib, in escalating doses per cohort, was combined with ifosfamide, 9 g/m2 for 3 days or 6 g/m2 for 5 days, administered every 3 weeks. Neutropenia-related adverse events were dose-limiting toxicities. Sunitinib did not affect ifosfamide PK. Ifosfamide significantly decreased exposure to sunitinib and increased exposure to its metabolite, SU12662. No consistent changes in PD parameters were observed. Ifosfamide produced decreased sunitinib blood levels due to CYP3A induction. As PK interactions cannot explain the relatively low sunitinib doses that can be combined with ifosfamide, synergy in toxicity is likely. Whether this is true for anti-tumour activity needs to be further explored.<br /><em>Decreased exposure to sunitinib due to concomitant administration of ifosfamide: results of a phase I and pharmacokinetic study on the combination of sunitinib and ifosfamide in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

<p>An in vitro study screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their ability to activate PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction. A CYP3A4 reporter gene assay was employed to identify PXR agonists among the eighteen anticancer drugs. Subsequently CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression following treatment with these PXR agonists was assessed. Finally, the effect of pre-treatment with these agents on the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam (a specific CYP3A4 probe) was determined. Ifosfamide was able to activate PXR and may therefore have the propensity to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions as a result of CYP3A4 induction.<br /><em>Nuclear receptor mediated induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by anticancer drugs: a key role for the pregnane X receptor.

<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that conversion to the active metabolite occurs via CYP3A4. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are involved in detoxification.

<p>CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes from 2 donors were determined using the oxidation of the dihydropyridine denitronifedipine, a specific CYP3A4 substrate, at a concentration of 50 microM (= KM). Formation of the pyridine metabolite was measured using HPLC. Ifosfamide showed an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, IC50 3.6/2.5 mmol/l for 2 microsome sample. Comparing IC50 values with plasma concentrations present during antineoplastic therapy, ifosfamide could possibly cause clinical drug interactions by inhibition of CYP3A4. <br /><em>Screening for inhibitory effects of antineoplastic agents on CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.

<p>Ketoconazole given orally for 4 days, starting 1 day before intravenous ifosfamide (given as a 24-hour infusion), decreased ifosfamide clearance. However, ifosfamide metabolism to active metabolites was decreased, and urinary excretion of ifosfamide was increased.

<p>Imatinib pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir (600 mg once daily for 3 days) were evaluated in 11 cancer patients receiving imatinib for at least 2 months (400-800 mg). The dose of imatinib was decreased by 50% during coadministration with ritonavir (for safety reasons) and pharmacokinetic parameters were normalised to an imatinib dose of 400 mg. Coadministration had no significant effect on imatinib AUC or Cmax (decreases of 3% and 13%, respectively). However, plasma exposure of CGP74588 (an active metabolite) was increased by approximately 40%. A population analysis with a time-dependent covariate confirmed that ritonavir did not influence the clearance or bioavailability of imatinib. The authors suggest that at steady state imatinib is insensitive to acute CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and relies on alternate elimination pathways.<br /><em>Influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of imatinib. van Erp NP, Gelderblom H, Karlsson MO et al.

                    <span><div>When administered alone, imipenem is metabolised in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase-I. Individual urinary recoveries ranged from 5 to 40%, with an average recovery of 15-20% in several studies. Cilastatin is a specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I enzyme and effectively inhibits metabolism of imipenem so that concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin allows therapeutic antibacterial levels of imipenem to be attained in both urine and plasma.<br />Approximately 70% of the administered antibiotic was recovered intact in the urine within ten hours, and no further urinary excretion of imipenem was detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem exceeded 10 &#956;g/ml for up to eight hours after a 500 mg/500 mg dose of imipenem/cilastatin. The remainder of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as antibacterially inactive metabolites, and faecal elimination of imipenem was essentially nil.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<div>Approximately 70-80% of the dose of cilastatin was recovered unchanged in the urine as cilastatin within 10 hours of administration of imipenem/cilastatin. No further cilastatin appeared in the urine thereafter. Approximately 10% was found as the N-acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase comparable to that of cilastatin. Activity of dehydropeptidase-I in the kidney returned to normal levels shortly after the elimination of cilastatin from the blood stream.<br /><em>Primaxin&#174; IV Injection Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Limited, updated October 2011<br />Primaxin&#174; I.V.

<p>Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased indinavir AUC by 178%, based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily); ritonavir AUC increased by 72%. Coadministration of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) had no effect on indinavir AUC but increased Cmin by 4-fold (based on cross-study comparison to indinavir alone (800 mg three daily); ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of indinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established.

<p>Alterations in concentrations of indinavir are noted when reduced doses are coadministered with ritonavir. Coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 15 days) and indinavir (400 mg twice daily for 15 days) with food was studied in 10 subjects. Effects were assessed relative to indinavir alone (800 mg every 8 hours) given under fasting conditions. On day 15, indinavir AUC decreased by 7%, Cmax decreased by 62%, and Cmin increased 4-fold.

<p>The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established. Preliminary clinical data suggest that indinavir 400 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg, both administered orally twice daily, may be an alternative dosing regimen. A boosted dose of 800 mg indinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice daily results in increased risk of adverse events. Coadministration of indinavir (800 mg twice daily) was studied with different doses of ritonavir (100-400 mg twice daily) and compared to historical data from indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Coadministration with ritonavir 100 mg increased indinavir AUC by 178% and Cmin by 11-fold; ritonavir AUC increased by 72% and Cmin increased by 62%. Coadministration with ritonavir 200 mg increased indinavir AUC by 266% and Cmin by 24-fold; ritonavir AUC increased by 96% and Cmin increased by 371%. Coadministration with ritonavir 400 mg increased indinavir AUC by 220% and Cmin by 24-fold; ritonavir AUC was unchanged. Coadministration of a lower dose of indinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 or 100 mg twice daily) was also compared to historical data from indinavir alone (800 mg three times daily). Coadministration with ritonavir 400 mg increased indinavir AUC by 68% and Cmin by 10-fold; there was no effect on ritonavir concentrations. Coadministration with ritonavir 100 mg resulted in AUC and Cmin values for indinavir that were comparable to the reference regimen.

<p>Compared to historical data in patients who received indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours alone, twice-daily coadministration to volunteers of indinavir 800 mg and 100 mg ritonavir with food for two weeks resulted in an 2.7-fold increase of indinavir AUC, a 1.6-fold increase in Cmax, and an 11-fold increase in Cmin. Following a 200 mg ritonavir dose, there was a 3.6-fold increase of indinavir AUC, a 1.8-fold increase in Cmax, and a 24-fold increase in Cmin. In the same study, twice-daily coadministration of indinavir (800 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg) resulted in increases in ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 61%, 72% and 62% respectively; increases following a 200 mg ritonavir dose were 19%, 96% and 4.7-fold for ritonavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin respectively. The appropriate doses for this combination, with respect to efficacy and safety, have not been established.

<p>Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) is eliminated from plasma with a short half-life (about 0.7h). The metabolic degradation of ISDN occurs via denitration and glucuronidation, like all organic nitrates. The rate of formation of the metabolites has been calculated for isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN) with 0.27 h -1, and isosorbide (IS) with 0.16 h-1. IS-5-MN and IS-2-MN are the primary metabolites which are also pharmacologically active. IS-5-MN is metabolised to isosorbide 5-mononitrate-2-glucuronide (IS-5-MN-2-GLU). The half-life of this metabolite (about 2.5h) is shorter than that of IS-5-MN (about 5.1h). The half-life of ISDN is the shortest of all and that of IS-2-MN (about 3.2h) lies in between. <br /><em>Isoket&#174; (Isosorbide dinitrate) 1mg/ml injection/infusion UK Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Limited, updated July 2010</em></p>
<p>A study was designed to elucidate the role of human cytochrome P450 isoforms on nitric oxide formation from organic nitrates using lymphoblast microsomes transfected with human CYP isoforms cDNA. CYP3A4-transfected microsomes had the most effective potential of nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate. Anti-CYP3A2 antibody (which cross-reacts with CYP3A4) or ketoconazole (an inhibitor of the CYP3A superfamily) inhibited nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate in rat heart microsomes. Immunohistochemistry of human heart also showed intense bindings of CYP3A4 antibody in the endothelium of the endocardium and coronary vessels. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase system specifically participates in nitric oxide formation from isosorbide dinitrate.<br /><em>Minamiyama Y, Takemura S, Akiyama T et al.

                    <span>A case report describes a patient with AIDS (10-year evolution) and Parkinsonson's disease, treated with L-dopa (plus DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor [DCI]), 2400 mg indinavir per day, 500 mg zidovudine, and 300 mg lamivudine. Parkinsons had been diagnosed 5 years previously, treatment with L-dopa plus DCI was effective and well tolerated. After 1 month of treatment with the anti-HIV triple therapy and an unchanged daily dose of L-dopa, the patient developed severe dyskinesias occurring at the peak dose periods, whereas the on-periods lasted the whole day without fluctuations. The antiviral drugs were stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days. The antiviral drugs were later reintroduced separately for a minimum of 2 weeks. Indinavir alone induced the abnormal movements after 3 days of treatment but the two other antiviral drugs did not. Indinavir was definitively stopped and dyskinesias improved within 5 days, whereas the motor status worsened progressively with the reappearance of fluctuations. The authors suggest that as protease inhibitors inhibit the hepatic metabolism of several drugs by inhibition of cytochrome P450, which catalyzes oxidative reactions produced by MAO or COMT, the latency in appearance and disappearance of this adverse effect, namely, the enhanced effect of L-dopa, could be related to a progressive inhibition of proteases but also to delayed dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity. When indinavir and catecholaminergic drugs have to be administered together, this should lead to a reduction in daily requirements of the latter.<br /><em>Protease inhibitors enhance levodopa effects in Parkinson's disease.

Similarly, ritonavir could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Further studies are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of non-oral contraceptives containing only levonorgestrel. Of note: when used in combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Levothyroxine is metabolized by deiodination (by enzymes of deiodinase family) and glucuronidation. Cases of hypothyroidism have been reported when combining levothyroxine with ritonavir, indinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. This interaction has been attributed to the induction of glucuronidation thereby increasing elimination of levothyroxine. Close monitoring of thyroid hormone parameters is recommended and adjustment of the levothyroxine dose may be necessary if clinically indicated.</span>

                    <span>In a sequential pharmacokinetic study, healthy male volunteers (n=8) were administered a single oral dose of 1000mg mebendazole, in absence and after short-term (2 doses) and long-term (8 days) treatment with ritonavir 200mg twice daily. A trend towards an increase in mebendazole exposure after short-term intake of ritonavir was seen. However long-term administration resulted in a significant decrease in mebendazole AUC0-24 (57%) and Cmax (59%). Tmax and the terminal half-life were not significantly changed. The observation is most likely due to a ritonavir-mediated induction of metabolising enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP1A2, UGTs) or transporters, although changes in absorption are also possible. These findings need to be replicated with a key boosted PI such as lopinavir/ritonavir. <br /><em>Effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole: an interaction study in healthy volunteers.

                    <span><p>Melarsoprol is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolised to the active form, melarsen oxide. Melarsoprol itself has a plasma half-life of 30 minutes and is excreted in the faeces and urine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press (via Medicines Complete), last reviewed 2011-03-03</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of melarsoprol have not been fully evaluated. Using biological assay and atomic absorption spectrometry, the terminal half-life of melarsoprol was originally calculated to be 35 hours and low trypanocidal activity was detected in the CSF. When the terminal half-life was calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), melarsoprol was found to be eliminated from the plasma within 1 hour. Based on these findings it is thought that melarsoprol is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and transformed into metabolites with trypanocidal activity. Melarsen oxide has been identified by HPLC as a metabolite; the peak plasma concentration was reached 15 minutes after a dose and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours.<br /><em>Bronner U, et al. Discrepancy in plasma melarsoprol concentrations between HPLC and bioassay methods in patients with T. gambiense sleeping sickness indicates that melarsoprol is metabolized. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 913&#8211;7.</em></p>
<p>The half-life of melarsoprol determined by HPLC was &lt;1 hour compared with 35 hours determined by bioassay and atomic absorption spectroscopy, indicating the existence of active metabolites. One metabolite, melarsen oxide, was identified by ultraviolet HPLC after incubation of melarsoprol with microsomes. Melarsen oxide could also be detected at the same concentration range in the control run without NaDPH. This indicates that melarsen oxide might not be formed only in a microsomal reaction but also by hydrolysis. The maximum plasma concentration of melarsen oxide was reached 15 minutes after administration; the clearance was 21.5 mL/min/kg and the half-life of free melarsen oxide was 3.9 hours. Either melarsen oxide or a yet-undiscovered active metabolite is irreversibly bound to proteins, as shown by ultrafiltration, precipitation experiments, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. <br /><em>Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol. Keiser J, Ericsson O, Burri C. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 May;67(5):478-88.</em></p>
<p>Patients with advanced leukemia (n=8) received escalating intravenous doses of melarsoprol daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/ kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, which ranged from 1.2 &#181;g/ml on day 1 to 2.4 &#181;g/ml on day 3. Plasma areas under the concentration-times-time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the administered dose, ranging from 0.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 1 to 1.48 &#181;g.h/ml on day 3. Peak plasma levels were dose-proportional and decayed with a t1/2 of 15 min. Levels of the parent compound were undetectable in plasma at 24 h. There was no detectable level of parent drug in urine at any time. Blood and urine samples were also analyzed for elemental arsenic content. The mean plasma AUC of arsenic on day 1 was 6038 &#181;g.h/ml (range 4497&#177; 9095 &#181;g.h/ml), T1/2a was 38 min and T1/2b was 19.5 h. There was a gradual increase in trough plasma levels of elemental arsenic over the 3-week treatment course.<br /><em>Clinical study of an organic arsenical, melarsoprol, in patients with advanced leukemia.

<p>The coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 15 days) with methadone (5 mg single dose) was investigated in 11 subjects. Effects were assessed on a dose-normalised comparison to a methadone 20 mg single dose. Methadone AUC and Cmax were reduced by 36% and 38%, respectively.

<p>The effect of ritonavir 400 mg/saquinavir 400 mg twice daily on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of methadone was examined in 12 HIV-infected, methadone-using study subjects Ritonavir/saquinavir administration was associated with 40% decrease in the AUC0-24h for total S-methadone and 32% decrease in R-methadone: both changes were statistically significant (p = .001 for both). When AUC was corrected for the changes in protein binding induced by ritonavir/saquinavir, R-methadone free AUC0&#8211;24h decreased 19.6% whereas the S-methadone decreased 24.6%, neither of these changes was statistically significant (p = .129 and p = .0537, respectively). This change in methadone exposure was not associated with any evidence of withdrawal from narcotics and no modification of methadone dose was required.<br /><em>Effect of ritonavir/saquinavir on stereoselective pharmacokinetics of methadone: results of AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 401.

<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg 12 hourly) and a single dose of methadone (5 mg single dose) was studied in 11 healthy volunteers.

                    <span><p>Methyldopa is excreted in urine largely by glomerular filtration, primarily unchanged and as the mono-O-sulfate conjugate. Delayed excretion and accumulation of this metabolite occur in patients with renal insufficiency and may cause an increased hypotensive effect during methyldopa therapy. Unabsorbed methyldopa is excreted in the feces unchanged. Methyldopa is removed by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, 01/2009</em></p>
<p>A study examined the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of methyldopa after single 250mg oral and intravenous doses to 16 healthy human volunteers with a 48-hour washout period between oral and intravenous treatments. Methyldopa was assayed in blood and urine, and its metabolites (methyldopa sulfate, alpha-methyldopamine, and alpha-methyldopamine sulfate) were assayed in urine. The measurable metabolites in urine after oral and intravenous administration accounted for 27% and 17% of the dose, respectively. Methyldopa sulfate was the most abundant metabolite recorded; its quantity was higher after oral than after intravenous administration, 20.1 +/- 5.7% versus 6.7 +/- 5.3% of the dose (P &lt; .05), suggesting significant presystemic gut metabolism. First-pass gut metabolism for methyldopa was estimated to be 17.6 +/- 6.9% of the dose given.<br /><em>Skerjanec A, Campbell NR, Robertson S, Tam YK.

No oxidative metabolism of miltefosine was observed in in vitro studies with 15 CYP450 Isozymes. No CYP3A induction was observed in animal studies. A slow metabolic degradation in human hepatocytes was demonstrated, in which a phospholipase D-like cleavage of miltefosine causes the release of choline. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that only a very small proportion of the administered dose is excreted in the unchanged form.

                    <span><p>Misoprostol is predominantly metabolised via fatty acid oxidising systems and has shown no adverse effect on the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (P450) enzyme system. In specific studies no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction has been demonstrated with antipyrine or diazepam. A modest increase in propranolol concentrations (mean approximately 20% in AUC, 30% in Cmax) has been observed with multiple dosing of misoprostol. In extensive clinical studies no drug interactions have been attributed to Misoprostol. <br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Limited updated November 2010</em></p>
<p>Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid deesterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important. Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant. Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.<br /><em>Cytotec&#174; (Misoprostol) tablets US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, Revised September 2009</em></p></span>

<p>Concentrations of nelfinavir were increased when coadministered with ritonavir. Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg every 8 hours for 5 doses) with ritonavir (500 mg single dose), in 10 subjects, caused no alteration in ritonavir AUC or Cmax. Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 3 doses) with a single dose of nelfinavir (750 mg), in 10 subjects led to a 152% and 44% increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively.

<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (500 mg or 750 mg twice daily) was studied in 10 HIV patients. Ritonavir increased the AUC of NLF 500 mg (28 &#181;g/ml.h) and 750 mg bd (26 &#181;g/ml.h) when compared with historical 750 mg controls (20 &#181;g/ml.h). AUC of M8 also increased: 19 &#181;g/ml.h (500 mg), 25 &#181;g/ml.h (750 mg), 6 &#181;g/ml.h (750 mg controls). Concurrent ritonavir increased nelfinavir AUC and significantly increased concentrations of M8. Optimal dose of this BD combination must be determined in long-term treatment trials.<br /><em>Steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir, nelfinavir and the nelfinavir active metabolite M8.

<p>This study describes the effect on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (1250 mg bd) of adding 100 or 200 mg RTV. This was a randomised, open-label, one-sequence crossover study in healthy volunteers of NFV dosed alone for 17 days and then with RTV for another 14 days. Irrespective of dose, RTV increased the AUC of NFV by 20% and 39% after both morning and evening administration respectively. The AUC of the metabolite M8 was increased by 74% and 86% after the morning and evening doses (this is either induction of formation of M8 by CYP2C19 or inhibition of the further metabolism of M8 which is catalysed by CYP3A4). During ritonavir combination therapy, a clear but minor drug effect on nelfinavir pharmacokinetics was demonstrated but no dose effect was shown. <br /><em>Low dose ritonavir moderately enhances nelfinavir exposure.

Protein binding to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Following intramuscular administration, Neostigmine is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. In a study of five patients with myasthenia gravis, peak plasma levels were observed at 30 minutes, and the half-life ranged from 51 to 90 minutes. Approximately 80 percent of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hours; approximately 50% as the unchanged drug and 30 percent as metabolites.<br /><em>Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection USP UA Prescribing Information, American Reagent Inc, updated January 2009</em></p>
<p>Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.<br /><em>Somani SM, Chan K, Dehghan A, Calvey TN.

<p>A 51-year-old man with HIV infection who was receiving extended-release nifedipine (60 mg/day) developed symptomatic orthostasis and heart block after starting antiretroviral therapy that included nelfinavir (1250 mg twice daily). Other medication included losartan-hydrochlorothiazide (100/25 mg per day), atenolol (100 mg/day), clopidogrel (75 mg/day), aspirin (325 mg/day), zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and lamivudine (150 mg twice daily). He experienced dizziness, fatigue, and hypotension and developed complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Electrocardiogram abnormalities abated within 24 hours of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy. Medication was changed to nifedipine (60 mg/day), losartan (50 mg/day), aspirin (81 mg/day) and atenolol (50 mg/day), however, the patient developed orthostatic symptoms after restarting nelfinavir. He was switched successfully to an efavirenz-based regimen (efavirenz 600 mg once daily, stavudine 40 mg twice daily, didanosine 400 mg/day). Subsequent administration of antiretroviral therapy containing indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg twice daily) with extended-release nifedipine resulted in recurrence of his orthostatic symptoms. Drug therapy at that time consisted of nifedipine (60 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), losartan (50 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) and abacavir (300 mg twice daily). Discontinuation of atenolol, and nifedipine dosage reduction to 30 mg/day were effective in managing his orthostatic changes.<br /><em>Symptomatic Orthostasis With Extended-Release Nifedipine and Protease Inhibitors.

<p>Nifurtimox (Nfx) has serious toxic effects including mutagenic, reproductive and carcinogenic actions. Its toxicity has been linked to NADPH dependent nitroreductive metabolic biotransformation with production of oxygen reactive species. Rat liver nuclei exhibit Nfx-nitroreductase activity (Nfx-ase). This activity is null under oxygen and partially inhibited under CO. Results suggest that Nfx is biotransformed partially at a cytochrome P450 level but mostly by NADPH P450 reductase. Formation of reactive metabolites nearby DNA and nuclear proteins might be related to long term deleterious effects of this drug.<br /><em>Rat liver nuclear nifurtimox nitroreductase activity. de Toranzo EG, Herrera DM, Castro JA. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1997 Dec;98(3):249-54.</em></p>
<p>Liver microsomal (mic); nuclei (N) and mitochondria (mit) anaerobically nitroreduce Nifurtimox (Nfx) in the presence of NADPH generating system. Simultaneous formation of small amounts of nitrite was observed in microsomes and nuclei but not in mitochondria. The microsomal nitroreductase activity was enhanced by the presence of flavine-adenine-dinucleotide disodium salt (FAD), was not inhibited by CO and was significantly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In the microsomal NADPH-dependent fraction nitrite formation was null in the presence of FAD, DPI and under air and was partially inhibited by pure CO. Pure human cytochrome P450 reductase in the presence of NADPH significantly nitroreduced Nfx and produced small amounts of nitrite. The nitroreductive process was significantly enhanced by FAD but the nitrite formation became null. FAD itself was able to chemically nitroreduce Nfx without production of nitrite. NADPH generating system enhanced the FAD nitroreductive effect and led to small production of nitrite. Formation of reactive metabolites and nitric oxide during Nfx metabolism might contribute to its toxicity.<br /><em>Nifurtimox biotransformation to reactive metabolites or nitrite in liver subcellular fractions and model systems.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Nilotinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and has been shown to prolong the QT interval. Coadministration could potentially increase nilotinib concentrations and thus increase the risk for QT interval prolongation. Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir) should be avoided. Should treatment be required, it is recommended that therapy with nilotinib be interrupted if possible. If transient interruption of treatment is not possible, close monitoring of the individual for prolongation of the QT interval is indicated.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Norgestrel is a racemic mixture with levonorgestrel being biologically active. Levonorgestrel is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration could potentially increase levonorgestrel exposure. Of note: when used in a combined pill, the estrogen component is reduced. Given the lack of clinical data on the contraceptive efficacy, caution is recommended and additional contraceptives measures should be used in addition to oral contraception.</span>

                    <span><p>The effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was determined in 14 healthy volunteers (13 male, 1 female). Ritonavir was titrated to 500 mg twice daily over 7 days with 500 mg bd adminstered for 4 days prior to olanzapine administration. Ritonavir administration resulted in a 53% reduction in olanzapine AUC (501 to 253 ng/ml.h) and a 40% reduction in olanzapine Cmax (15 to 9 ng/ml). The geometric mean ritonavir trough concentration was 5100 ng/ml (range 2500-12000 ng/ml).The data suggest that some patients receiving these drugs in combination may experience reduced therapuetic benefit from olanzapine.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat may theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medicines and could negatively affect the efficacy of HIV antiretrovirals. The decrease in dietary fat absorption due to orlistat could eventually reduce absorption of antiretrovirals (especially if lipophilic). This may be due to retention of lipophilic medicines in the gastrointestinal tract or reduced gastrointestinal tract transit time. Initiate orlistat treatment only after careful consideration of the possible impact on efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines. If coadministration is considered necessary, monitor antiretroviral drug levels.</span>

                      <span>Oxycodone is metabolised principally to noroxycodone via CYP3A and oxymorphone via CYP2D6. Oxymorphone has some analgesic activity but is present in the plasma in low concentrations and is not considered to contribute to oxycodone's pharmacological effect. Coadministration a single dose of oxycodone (10 mg) and ritonavir (300 mg twice daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) increased the AUC of oxycodone by 3.0- and 2.6-fold, respectively. A dose reduction of oxycodone may be required to avoid opioid-related adverse effects.</span>

Close monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended. Dose reduction of pazopanib should be considered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 if coadministration cannot be avoided.</span>

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Although metabolism of penicillamine is not fully elucidated, multiple mechanisms and sites of metabolism are thought to be involved. There is therefore low potential for clinically significant interactions with ritonavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                  <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                    <span><p>Penicillamine is absorbed rapidly but incompletely (40-70%) from the gastrointestinal tract, with wide inter-individual variations. Food, antacids, and iron reduce absorption of the drug. The peak plasma concentration of penicillamine occurs 1-3 hours after ingestion; it is approximately 1-2mg/L after an oral dose of 250 mg. The drug appears in the plasma as free penicillamine, penicillamine disulfide, and cysteine-penicillamine disulfide. When prolonged treatment is stopped, there is a slow elimination phase lasting 4-6 days. More than 80% of plasma penicillamine is bound to proteins, especially albumin and ceruloplasmin. The drug also binds to erythrocytes and macrophages. A small fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver to S-methyl-D-penicillamine. Excretion is mainly renal, mainly as disulfides.<br /><em>Cuprimine&#174; (Penicillamine) capsules, US Prescribing Information, Aton Pharma, updated October 2008</em></p>
<p>Very little information is available on the metabolism of the penicillamine that is not excreted as part of a metal or cysteine complex. The drug is believed to be metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces, principally as inactive disulfides: penicillamine disulfide, penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, and small amounts of S-methyl-d-penicillamine. The manufacturers report that penicillamine is rarely excreted unchanged in urine. In one study, about 50% of a dose of penicillamine was excreted in urine, about 20% in feces, and about 30% was unaccounted for after 24 hours.<br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, updated April 2009</em></p>
<p>The transformation of D-penicillamine (D-pen) was studied in orally- and intravenously-dosed rats and in human plasma in vitro. In each case, low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites (previously identified as disulphides) and a mixed disulphide between D-pen and albumin (D-pen-protein) formed. The rates of D-pen elimination, other than through protein conjugation, were comparable in the rat groups to the rate of oxidation to LMW metabolites in vitro. The rates of transformation to D-pen-protein were also comparable in the in vitro preparations and in orally-treated rats. These qualitative and quantitative similarities suggest blood plasma may be an important site of transformation in vivo. Extracellular oxidation of D-pen may be linked to its antirheumatic action, either through reduction of oxygen species or through formation of D-pen-protein disulphides at surfaces of mononuclear leukocytes.<br /><em>Joyce DA, Murphy BR.

<p>The use of meperidine and ritonavir is contraindicated due to the increased concentrations of the metabolite, normeperidine, which has both analgesic and CNS stimulant activity. Elevated normeperidine concentrations may increase the risk of CNS effects (e.g., seizures). Coadministration of pethidine (50 mg single oral dose) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) decrease pethidine AUC and Cmin by 62% and 59%, respectively, but increased normeperidine AUC and Cmin by 47% and 87%, respectively. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days) with a single dose of meperidine (50 mg oral dose) caused a 62% and 59% decrease in meperidine AUC and Cmax, respectively (n=8), and a 47% and 87% increase in the normepridine metabolite AUC and Cmax, respectively (n=6). Dosage increase and long term use of meperidine with ritonavir are not recommended due to the increased concentrations of the metabolite normepridine which has both analgesic activity and CNS stimulant activity (e.g. seizures). <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The effect of ritonavir (500 mg bd) on the pharmacokinetics of pethidine (meperidine; 50 mg oral) was studied in 8 healthy volunteers. In the presence of ritonavir, the AUC of pethidine decreased by 67% and Cmax decrease from 126&#177;47 to 51&#177;21 ng/ml. The AUC of the metabolite (norpethidine/normeperidine) increased by 47%. Based on these findings, the risk of narcotic-related adverse effects from this combination appears to be minimal. However, the increased concentrations of the metabolite suggest a potential for toxicity with increased dosages or long-term therapy. <br /><em>The effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of meperidine and normeperidine.

<p>An in vitro study aimed to determine the role of CYP4F2 in the metabolism of vitamin K1 by human liver.

A screen of all commercially available P450 Supersomes showed that only CYP4F2 was capable of metabolizing vitamin K1 to this product. These data demonstrate that CYP4F2 is a vitamin K(1) oxidase and that carriers of the CYP4F2 V433M allele have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K1, secondary to an rs2108622-dependent decrease in steady-state hepatic concentrations of the enzyme. <br /><em>CYP4F2 is a vitamin K1 oxidase: An explanation for altered warfarin dose in carriers of the V433M variant.

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. Based on the metabolism/elimination profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction when pilocarpine is used either orally or as eye drops. Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and serum esterases, there is therefore little potential for interaction with ritonavir via modulation of, or competition for metabolic pathways.</span>

                    <span><p><strong>Systemic use:</strong> Pilocarpine is primarily metabolized by CYP2A6 and has demonstrated a capacity to inhibit CYP2A6 in vitro. Serum esterases are also involved in the biotransformation of pilocarpine to pilocarpic acid. Approximately 35% of dose is eliminated as 3-hydroxypilocarpine in urine and 20% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Mean elimination half-lives for pilocarpine is 0.76 and 1.35 hours after repeated oral doses of 5 and 10 mg of pilocarpine hydrochloride, respectively.<br /><em>Salagen&#174; (Pilocarpine) 5mg Film Coated Tablets UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, updated November 2011</em></p>
<p><strong>Ocular use:</strong> Systemic reactions rarely occur when treating chronic simple glaucoma at normal doses. However, in the treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma the possibility of systemic reactions must be considered because of the higher doses given. Pilocarpine has a low ocular bioavailability when topically applied and this has been attributed to extensive pre-corneal drug loss in conjunction with the resistance to normal corneal penetration. Further, pilocarpine appears to bind to the eye pigments from which it is gradually released to the muscles. Inactivation of pilocarpine in the eye is thought to occur by a hydrolysing enzyme. The amount of this enzyme is not changed by the prolonged use of pilocarpine by glaucoma patients, nor is it changed in patients poorly controlled by glaucoma therapy.<br /><em>Minims Pilocarpine Nitrate 2% w/v Eye drops solution UK Summary of Product Characteristics, Bausch &amp; Lomb U.K Limited, updated July 2012</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Prasugrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Ritonavir (100 mg) has been shown to reduce prasugrel active metabolite Cmax and AUC by 45% and 38%, respectively. Ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) reduced prasugrel Cmax by 34-46% but without changes in prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Similarly, grapefruit juice (a strong inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4) reduced the activation of prasugrel but this had limited effect on the antiplatelet effect. Based on these data, coadministration could potentially reduce the activation of prasugrel, but without a significant reduction in prasugrel efficacy.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Primaquine is metabolised mainly through a non-CYP mediated mechanism and only a small fraction of the drug is believed to be metabolised through CYP450. The oxidative metabolites rather than the parent drug are primarily responsible for the haemolytic effects of primaquine. In theory, inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir could potentially reduce the conversion to haemotoxic metabolites.</span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. Proguanil is partly excreted unchanged and partly metabolized to its more active metabolite cycloguanil by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. The AUCs of single dose atovaquone/proguanil (250/100 mg) were significantly lower in HIV-infected individuals on stable antiretroviral treatment containing atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz than in healthy volunteers. The decrease in proguanil exposure has been attributed to possible induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown due to the lack of data on the minimal effective atovaquone plasma concentration in the setting of malaria prophylaxis. Consider taking atovaquone/proguanil with a high fat meal to increase its bioavailability and increase the dosage if required.</span>

Pyridostigmine is excreted mainly in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. It appears that 75% of the plasma clearance of pyridostigmine depends on renal function. 3-Hydroxy-N-methylpyridinium has been identified as one of the 3 metabolites isolated from the urine of patients taking pyridostigmine.<br /><em>Martindale Complete Drug Reference. Pharmaceutical Press(via Medicines Complete), last modified 2011-04-15</em><br />&nbsp;<br />To assess the contribution of tubular secretion to the renal excretion of pyridostigmine, and its modification by other cationic drugs, six volunteers were given single oral doses of 60mg pyridostigmine bromide with and without co-administration of ranitidine or pirenzepine. In patients with myasthenia receiving continuous pyridostigmine therapy, renal clearance values were obtained in the same manner with and without ranitidine (10 patients) or pirenzepine (nine patients) co-medication. Pyridostigmine renal clearance averaged 6.65 ml/min per kg (350% of the creatinine clearance) in all subjects, 74% being due to net tubular secretion. Mean values for pyridostigmine renal clearance and for clearance by secretion were decreased in the presence of pirenzepine, but plasma concentrations were not affected significantly. Ranitidine caused a small non-significant decrease of the pyridostigmine clearance in patients. The renal clearance of creatinine was slightly increased by pyridostigmine in volunteers and slightly decreased by pirenzepine in the total group of subjects.<br /><em>Eiermann B, Sommer N, Winne D, Schumm F, Maier U, Breyer-Pfaff U.

The European SPC for quetiapine contraindicates quetiapine with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as HIV protease inhibitors). However, the US Prescribing Information recommends that quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if coadministered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.

<p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 9 days) and single doses of quinine (600 mg) was studied in healthy volunteers during a three-period pharmacokinetic non-randomized sequential design study. Pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, quinine and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, were determined. Ritonavir increased quinine Cmax and AUC by 2.8-fold and 3.4-fold, respectively, with a 77% decrease in clearance. This, together with a decrease in the Cmax (50%) and AUC (60%) of the metabolite, resulted in a pronounced reduction in the ratio of metabolite:unchanged drug AUC. Quinine caused modest but significant increases in the Cmax (15%), AUC (21%) and elimination half life (32%) of ritonavir. Downward dosage adjustment of quinine appears necessary when concurrently administered with ritonavir. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between ritonavir and quinine in healthy volunteers following concurrent administration.

<p>A clinical study evaluated retinol levels in patients with or without HAART and assessed the effect of antiretroviral agents on retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), a key enzyme involved in retinoic acid synthesis. Plasma retinol levels, measured in six patients receiving HAART and in five others with no antiretroviral therapy, were correlated with levels of serum retinol-binding proteins. Plasma retinol levels in patients receiving HAART were decreased in comparison with those not receiving antiretroviral drugs (51 +/- 5 versus 66 +/- 11 microg/dl; P = 0.03), whereas retinol-binding protein levels were increased (68 +/- 18 versus 45 +/- 10 mg/l; P = 0.04). RALDH activity was heightened by ritonavir (24%), indinavir (17%), saquinavir (17%), zalcitabine (14%), delavirdine (12%) and nelfinavir (10%) and decreased (22%) by DMP-450. RALDH gene expression was induced only by indinavir. These data indicate that certain retinoid-like adverse effects in HAART-receiving patients are not due to higher retinol levels. Enhanced RALDH activity or/and gene expression by some protease inhibitors could increase retinoic acid concentrations. Elevated retinoic acid levels might be responsible for retinoid-like or other adverse effects due to alterations in the expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes.<br /><em>Toma E, Devost D, Chow Lan N, Bhat PV.

                    <div class="interaction-info-divide">
                      <span>Initial pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers showed that concentrations of rifabutin and its active metabolite (25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) were significantly increased when combined with a boosted protease inhibitor whereas rifabutin had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of most boosted protease inhibitors. Thus, a reduction of rifabutin dosage to 150 mg three times a week was recommended to reduce the risk of rifabutin related toxicity. However, more recent pharmacokinetic data derived from HIV/TB co-infected patients have shown that the coadministration of lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r and rifabutin (150 mg three times a week) resulted in rifabutin concentrations that were lower than those observed with rifabutin 300 mg once daily without protease inhibitors suggesting that rifabutin dosage may be inadequate. Of interest, cases of relapses with acquired rifamycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have been described in co-infected patients treated with rifabutin 150 mg  3 times a week and lopinavir/r or atazanavir/r. The US guidelines for HIV treatment now recommend the administration of rifabutin at a daily dosage of 150 mg with a boosted protease inhibitor. Due to the limited safety data with this dose and combination, patients receiving rifabutin 150 mg daily with a boosted protease inhibitor should be closely monitored for rifabutin-related toxicities (i.e. uveitis or neutropenia). Coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg daily) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) increased rifabutin AUC (4-fold) and Cmin (2.5-fold). The AUC and Cmin of 25-o-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite increased by 38-fold and 16-fold, respectively. The European SPC contraindicates coadministration with full dose ritonavir. </span>

In this case the charts reflect the use of low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to boost plasma concentrations of other protease inhibitors. There is also a difference in pharmacokinetics when rifabutin is given daily compared to once or twice weekly.</em></p>
<p>Due to the large increase in rifabutin AUC, the concomitant use of rifabutin with ritonavir dosed as an <strong>antiretroviral agent</strong> is contraindicated due to an increase of rifabutin serum concentrations and risk of adverse events including uveitis. Based on parallel group comparison, coadministration of rifabutin (150 mg daily) and ritonavir (500 mg twice daily) increased rifabutin AUC by 4-fold and Cmin by 2.5-fold. AUC and Cmin of 25-o-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite were increased by 38-fold and 16-fold respectively. The reduction of the rifabutin dose to 150 mg 3 times per week may be indicated for select PIs when co-administered with ritonavir as a <strong>pharmacokinetic enhancer</strong>. The Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 10 days) with rifabutin (150 mg daily for 16 days) was investigated using a study with parallel group design. Rifabutin AUC, Cmax and Cmin were increased by 4-, 2.5-and 6-fold, respectively. The 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin metabolite AUC, Cmax and Cmin were increased by 35-, 16-and 181-fold, respectively. Dosage reduction by at least three quarters of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (e.g. 150 mg every other day or three times a week). Further dosage adjustment may be necessary. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Nineteen patients (group 1 n=10, group 2 n=9) took part in a study to evaluate plasma exposures and safety of rifabutin and its active metabolite with a combination of ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) and saquinavir (400 mg twice daily). Group 1 received 300 mg rifabutin every 7 days and group 2 150 mg every 3 days for 8 weeks. Rifabutin exposures were similar at 4 and 8 weeks and had minimal effect on ritonavir and saquinavir. It is safe to use ritonavir and saquinavir with rifabutin on intermittent dosing over 8 weeks.<br /><em>A pharmacokinetic study of intermittent rifabutin dosing with a combination of ritonavir and saquinavir in patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg 12 hourly) and rifabutin (150 mg once daily) was studied in five healthy volunteers. There was a 4-fold increase in rifabutin AUC (0&#8211;24h) and a 35-fold increase in 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin. Rifabutin Cmax and Cmin increased by 2.5 and 6-fold, respectively. Cmax and Cmin of 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin increased by 16- and 200-fold, respectively. As both parent drug and metabolite have similar activities, the combined mean AUC increased nearly 7-fold in the presence of ritonavir. If ritonavir is to be administered concurrently with an antimycobacterial, an alternative to rifabutin (e.g. clarithromycin) is recommended. <br /><em>The effect of multiple doses of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin.

                    <span><p>Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data indicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is co-administered with rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of rifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may have no clinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high-dose ritonavir therapy. The effect of ritonavir on rifampicin is not known. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg every 12 hours for 20 days) with rifampicin (600 or 300 mg daily for 10 days) was investigated using a study with parallel group design. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin were decreased by 35%, 25% and 49%, respectively. Coadministration of rifampicin and ritonavir may lead to loss of virologic response. Alternative antimycobacterial agents, such as rifabutin, should be considered. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>A study was performed in eight HIV+ subjects receiving ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) and anti-TB therapy which included rifampicin (600 mg daily) with isoniazid and pyrazinamide. After 8 weeks, trough plasma concentrations ranged from 350 ng/ml to 5630 ng/ml and were stated to be above the IC95 (650 ng/ml &#8211;<em>LHPG: this value is lower than the generally accepted MEC for ritonavir &#8211; there is still need for caution</em>) in all but one subject. The authors conclude that ritonavir and rifampicin can be administered concomitantly in HIV+ subjects with TB and result in a good clinical, immunological and virological response.<br /><em>Treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients: safety and antiretroviral efficacy of the concomitant use of ritonavir and rifampin.

<p>A study was conducted on three HIV negative TB patients receiving rifampicin and indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg) and six healthy volunteers receiving indinavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg) without rifampicin. The AUCs of indinavir and ritonavir were decreased by 81 and 89%, respectively. The AUCs of rifampicin and its active metabolite were increased by 25 and 63% but their peak and trough concentrations were not influenced.<br /><em>Double trouble: A pharmacokinetic study of indinavir/ritonavir (800+100 mg bid) and rifampicin for patients co-infected with TB and HIV. de Gast M, Burger D, van Crevel R, et al. 2nd International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Noordwijk, the Netherlands, 2001, abstract 1.10.</em></p>

<p>Concurrent administration of salmeterol and ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risk of systemic side effects of salmeterol treatment. Concomitant use of systemic ketoconazole significantly increases systemic exposure to salmeterol. This may lead to an increase in the incidence of systemic effects (e.g. prolongation in the QTc interval and palpitations). Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once daily) and salmeterol (50 mcg inhaled twice daily) in 15 healthy subjects for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure (1.4-fold Cmax and 15-fold AUC). Clinically significant effects were not seen on blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose and blood potassium levels. Co-administration with ketoconazole did not increase the elimination half-life of salmeterol or increase salmeterol accumulation with repeat dosing. There is likely to be a similar risk of interaction with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, ritonavir). <br /><em>Serevent (salmeterol) Summary of Product Characteristics, Allen &amp; Hanburys, December 2009.</em></p>
<p>Due to the potential increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events, the concomitant use of salmeterol with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) is not recommended. In a placebo-controlled, crossover drug interaction study in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76; 90% CI: 10.66, 23.31) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose. Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta agonist&#8211;mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. <br /><em>Serevent (salmeterol) Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, March 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p><em><strong>LHPG Comment: </strong>Pharmacoenhancement of saquinavir by ritonavir is currently being investigated to allow once or twice daily dosing of saquinavir. Several such regimens are in clinical practice. Details of some of the studies are available as a table in the attached document. Ritonavir increases saquinavir plasma concentrations by inhibition of first pass metabolism, which raises Cmax, but has only a small effect on plasma half-life. Saquinavir has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir. Although interindividual variability in saquinavir concentrations is reduced, where possible therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to ensure adequate plasma concentrations of saquinavir. Details of the effect of ritonavir on saquinavir pharmacokinetics in some of the studies are available as a table in the attached document.</em></p>
<p>Saquinavir has been approved for use with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer at the noted doses: saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Initiate treatment with saquinavir 500 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, then saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in ART-na&#239;ve patients. Doses of ritonavir higher than 100 mg twice daily should not be used. Higher doses of ritonavir have been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Co-administration of saquinavir and ritonavir has led to severe adverse events, mainly diabetic ketoacidosis and liver disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 15-fold and Cmin by 5-fold; ritonavir AUC and Cmin were unchanged. Based on cross-study comparison to saquinavir alone (600 mg three daily), coadministration of saquinavir (400 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily) increased saquinavir AUC by 17-fold with no change in ritonavir AUC or Cmin. Ritonavir increases the serum levels of saquinavir as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. Saquinavir should only be given in combination with ritonavir. Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily provides saquinavir systemic exposure over 24 hours similar to or greater than those achieved with saquinavir 1200 mg three times daily without ritonavir. Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin, due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three medicines are given together. In a clinical study investigating the interaction of rifampicin 600 mg once daily and saquinavir 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily in healthy volunteers, severe hepatocellular toxicity with transaminase elevations up to &gt;20-fold the upper limit of normal after 1 to 5 days of co-administration was noted. Due to the risk of severe hepatoxicity, saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampicin. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>When coadministered with reduced doses of ritonavir, saquinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased. See the complete Prescribing Information for saquinavir for details on co-administration of saquinavir 1000 mg bid with ritonavir 100 mg bid. Saquinavir/ritonavir should not be given together with rifampin, due to the risk of severe hepatotoxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases) if the three drugs are given together. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The recommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg (2 x 500 mg film-coated tablets) two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. For treatment-naive patients initiating treatment with Invirase/ritonavir, the starting recommended dose of Invirase is 500 mg (1 x 500 mg film-coated tablet) two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the first 7 days of treatment. After 7 days, the recommended dose of Invirase is 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients switching immediately from treatment with another protease inhibitor taken with ritonavir or from a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor based regimen, without a wash-out period, should however initiate and continue Invirase at the standard recommended dose of 1000 mg two times daily with ritonavir 100 mg two times daily. Invirase film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and taken at the same time as ritonavir with or after food. In HIV-infected patients, Invirase or saquinavir soft capsules in combination with ritonavir at doses of 1000/100 mg twice daily provide a systemic exposure of saquinavir over a 24 hour period similar to or greater than that achieved with saquinavir soft capsules 1200 mg three times daily. <br /><em>Invirase Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, June 2012.</em></p>
<p>Inivrase (1000 mg twice daily) must be used in combination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) because it significantly inhibits saquinavir's metabolism to provide increased plasma saquinavir levels. When ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 14 days) was coadministered with saquinavir (soft gel 400 mg twice daily for 14 days), in 8 healthy volunteers, saquinavir AUC and Cmax increased by 121% and 64%, respectively, compared to standard soft gel regimen (1200 mg three times daily, n=33). When ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with saquinavir (hard gel 1000 mg twice daily, steady state), in 24 patients, saquinavir AUC and Cmax were increased by 1124% and 1325%, respectively, compared to standard saquinavir hard gel 600 mg (three times daily) regimen(n=114). <br /><em>Invirase Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, February 2012.</em></p></span>

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but ritonavir could potentially increase saxagliptin exposure as saxagliptin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4/5.  The US Prescribing Information states the recommended dose of saxagliptin to be 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors, (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).</span>

                    <span><p>Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5&#8209;fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced Cmax and AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin. The co&#8209;administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.<br /><em>Onglyza Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol Myers Squibb &#8211; Astra Zeneca, December 2011.</em></p>
<p>Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) and saxagliptin (20 mg or 100 mg single dose) increased saxagliptin AUC by ~2.5-3.7 fold and increased Cmax by ~1.6-2.4 fold. The AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite (5-hydroxy saxagliptin) decreased by 88% and 95% respectively when a single 100 mg dose of saxagliptin was coadministered with ketoconazole. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).

<div>Coadministration of ritonavir (500 mg twice daily every 8 hours) with a single dose of sildenafil (100 mg), in 28 subjects, caused an 11- and 4-fold increase in sildenafil AUC and Cmax, respectively. Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil in patients receiving ritonavir. Coadministration of ritonavir with sildenafil is expected to substantially increase sildenafil concentrations and may result in an increase in sildenafil-associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection. It is recommended not to exceed 25 mg every 48 hours and to use with increased monitoring for adverse events.<br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></div>
<p>The effect of ritonavir (500 mg bd) on a single dose of sildenafil (100 mg) was investigated in 28 healthy volunteers. There was an ~11 fold increase in sildenafil AUC and a ~4-fold increase sildenafil Cmax in the presence of ritonavir. Ritonavir delayed the Tmax of sildenafil by ~3.5h and half-life was increased from 3.8 to 5.7 h. Sildenafil did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir. A sildenafil starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients receiving concomitant potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. <br /><em>Pharmacokinetic interactions between the HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and saquinavir and Viagra (sildenafil citrate).

<div>Various case studies and trials of efficacy/tolerability of sodium stibogluconate describe Cardiotoxicity including QTc interval prolongation and occasionally torsades de pointes during, and occasionally after discontinuation of treatment.

                    <span><p>The sulfadiazine hydroxylamine metabolite has been linked to greatly increased rates of adverse reactions to sulfadiazine experienced by people with HIV infection. A study investigated the in vitro human cytochrome P450 (P450) and N-arylamine acetyltransferase (detoxification) metabolism of sulfadiazine. Formation of both the hydroxylamine and 4-hydroxy sulfadiazine was NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes (HLM). Significant (p &lt; 0.05) inhibition by selective P450 isoform inhibitor sulfaphenazole (2.1 microM; CYP2C9) indicated a role for CYP2C9 in the formation of the hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine formation correlated strongly with tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C8/9) in HLM (r = 0.76, p &lt; or = 0.004, n = 12). Fluconazole (CYP2C9/19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor at clinical concentrations) inhibited hydroxylamine formation, with one-enzyme model K(i) estimates ranging from 9 to 40 microM. Acetylation of sulfadiazine in human liver cytosol (HLC) correlated strongly with NAT2 activity as measured by sulfamethazine N-acetylation (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001, n = 12).&nbsp; The polymorphic acetylation of sulfadiazine may predispose slow acetylator patients to adverse reactions to sulfadiazine. On the basis of our K(i) estimates, clinical fluconazole concentrations of 25 microM would produce decreases of 40 to 70% in hepatic-mediated hydroxylamine production. Therefore, we predict that fluconazole may prove useful in the clinic as an in vivo inhibitor of sulfadiazine hydroxylamine formation to suppress adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><em>Identification of cytochrome P450 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase isoforms involved in sulfadiazine metabolism.

<p>A clinical study determined the inductive effect of &#8764;2 weeks of administration of nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), and rifampin (RIF; induction positive control) on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 and the inductive or inductive plus inhibitory effect of NFV, RTV, or RIF on CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in healthy human volunteers. Statistically significant induction of CYP1A2 (2.1-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold), CYP2B6 (1.8-, 2.4-, and 4-fold), and CYP2C9 (1.3-, 1.8-, and 2.6-fold) was observed after NFV, RTV, or RIF treatment, respectively (as expected, CYP2D6 was not induced). Moreover, we accurately predicted the in vivo induction of these enzymes by quantifying their induction by the PIs in human hepatocytes and by using RIF as an in vitro to in vivo scalar. On the basis of the modest in vivo induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9, the in vivo paradoxical DDIs with the PIs are likely explained by mechanisms other than induction of these enzymes such as induction of other metabolic enzymes, transporters, or both.<br /><em>Complex drug interactions of HIV protease inhibitors 2: in vivo induction and in vitro to in vivo correlation of induction of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 by ritonavir or nelfinavir.

These are also active, and the unsplit sulfasalazine (SASP) is also active on a variety of symptoms. Most SP is absorbed, hydroxylated or glucuronidated and a mix of unchanged and metabolised SP appears in the urine. Some ME is taken up and acetylated in the colon wall, such that renal excretion is mainly AC-ME. SASP is excreted unchanged in the bile and urine. Turning to mesalazine, in urine only AC-ME (not free ME) was demonstrable, the acetylation probably largely achieved in the colon mucosa. After a 3g SASP dose lag time was 6.1&#177;2.3 hours and plasma levels kept below 2&#181;g/ml total ME. Urinary excretion half life was 6.0&#177;3.1 hours and absorption half life based on these figures 3.0&#177;1.5 hours.

<p>Sulfasalazine is metabolised by intestinal bacteria to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-ASA. Approximately 15% of a dose of sulfasalazine is absorbed as parent and is metabolised to some extent in the liver to the same two species. The observed plasma half life for IV sulfasalazine is 7.6 &#177;3.4 hrs. The primary route of metabolism of SP is via acetylation to form AcSP. The rate of metabolism of SP to AcSP is dependent upon acetylator phenotype. SP can also be metabolised to 5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine and N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-sulfapyridine. 5-ASA is primarily metabolised in both the liver and intestine to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid via a non-acetylation phenotype dependent route. Due to low plasma levels produced by 5-ASA after oral administration, reliable estimates of plasma half lives are not possible. Absorbed SP and 5-ASA and their metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine either as free metabolites or glucuronide conjugates. The majority of 5-ASA stays within the colonic lumen and is excreted as 5-ASA and acetyl 5-ASA within the feces. The calculated clearance of sulfasalazine following IV administration was 1L/hr. Renal clearance was estimated to account for 37% of total clearance.<br /><em>Sulfasalazine tablets USP US Prescribing Information, Watson Laboratories Inc, updated May 2010</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>The clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin were studied in 4 patients with AIDS given 6.2 g intravenously over 5 weeks. Suramin accumulated during treatment and plasma concentrations exceeded 100 micrograms/mL for several weeks. After the last dose the terminal half-life of suramin ranged from 44 to 54 days. At least 99.7% was bound to plasma proteins. Renal clearance accounted for most (80%) of the elimination of suramin from the body. There appeared to be little or no metabolism of suramin.<br /><em>Collins JM, Klecker RW Jr, Yarchoan R, et al. Clinical pharmacokinetics of suramin in patients with HTLV-III/LAV infection.

<p>Suramin was administered to 49 patients in a Phase I cancer trial with real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose individualization to achieve targeted mean plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter during the 7-day period between days 15 and 22. Pharmacokinetic sampling after doses on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 was used to modify weekly suramin doses, beginning on day 15, in an attempt to achieve specific averaged plasma concentrations of 210 and 155 mg/liter. A 200-mg test dose was not effective in prospectively determining individual pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage requirements. Prospective use of surrogate substrates for CYP1A2, CYP3A3/4, and CYP2D6 showed no consistent effect of suramin on these enzymes. Although a correlation between creatinine clearance and suramin renal clearance was found (r2 = 0.38; P &lt; 0.00005), there was no correlation between creatinine clearance and total suramin clearance (P = 0.21). As expected for a drug eliminated renally by filtration, the extrapolated intercept of suramin renal clearance approximates zero at a creatinine clearance of 0 ml/min<br /><em>Hutson PR, Tutsch KD, Rago R, Renal clearance, tissue distribution, and CA-125 responses in a phase I trial of suramin.

Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen.

<p>Coadministration of low dose ritonavir (coformulated as lopinavir/ritonavir, 400/100 mg twice times daily for 14 days) and tenofovir-DF (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers. There was no change in tenofovir Cmax; AUC and Cmin increased by 32% and 51% respectively. There was no change in Cmax, AUC or Cmin for lopinavir or ritonavir. When low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily for 14 days) was coadministered with saquinavir (1000 mg twice daily ) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) in 35 healthy volunteers, there was no change in tenofovir AUC or Cmax, but Cmin increased by 23%. There was no change in ritonavir Cmax or AUC, but Cmin increased by 23%. <br />

<p>The coadministration of tenofovir diproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 18 HIV-1 infected individuals receiving saquinavir hard gel/ritonavir combination (1000/100 mg twice daily). On day 1, 12 h pharmacokinetic profiles for saquinavir and ritonavir were obtained, tenofovir was then added to the regimen and blood sampling repeated at days 3 and 14. Following the addition of tenofovir, saquinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations were not significantly different compared with day 1. Geometric mean ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the AUC on days 3 and 14 were 1.16 (0.97, 1.59) and 0.99 (0.87, 1.30) for saquinavir and 1.05 (0.92, 1.28) and 1.08 (0.97, 1.30) for ritonavir. <br />

<p>The effect of tenofovir on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir was investigated in 18 treatment experienced HIV+ patients. Lopinavir concentrations decreased in the presence of tenofovir (Cmin from 4.61 to 3.06 &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 10.68 to 9.65 &#181;g/ml). Decreases in ritonavir concentrations were also observed (Cmin from 0.63 to 0.35 &#181;g/ml; Cmax from 1.02 to 0.72 &#181;g/ml). Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir when coadministered with tenofovir may be useful to indicate if individual dose modification of lopinavir and/or ritonavir is required. <br />

<p>Coadministration of hard gel saquinavir/ritonavir (1000/100 mg twice daily) alone and with tenofovir (300 mg once daily) was studied in 40 healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were not substantially effected by saquinavir/ritonavir (Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 23%, 15% and 14% respectively). Ritonavir exposure was slightly increased; Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 23%, 10% and 11% respectively. Saquinavir Cmin was moderately enhanced (47% increase); Cmax and AUC increased by 22% and 29% respectively. All subjects achieved a SQV Cmin above 100 ng/ml. <br />

<p>Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg once daily, given with atazanavir) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 10 male HIV+ subjects. In the presence of tenofovir, there were decreases in ritonavir AUC (7011 to 5217 ng/ml.h), Cmax (886 to 642 ng/ml) and Cmin (43 to 39 ng/ml). Atazanavir concentrations were also decreased in the presence of tenofovir. <br />

                      <span>This interaction has not been studied. The isoenzymes involved in thiopental metabolism have not been identified. Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the duration of surgical anaesthesia or sleep time after thiopental injection in animals. Thiopental action does not appear to be limited by metabolism, but is determined by slow thiopental release from fat deposits. There is therefore little potential for ritonavir to affect thiopental exposure via enzyme inhibition. Although pentobarbital, a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism is formed during thiopental metabolism, levels do not reach therapeutic range. </span>

                    <span><p>Thiopental is almost completely metabolised in the body with a very small percentage excreted unchanged in urine. Ring desulfuration to the corresponding oxibarbiturate, pentobarbital, retains pharmacological activity. This active metabolite represents 3.3 to 3.6% of an anaesthetic dose and 10% of the parent concentration in the blood of patients receiving high dose thiopental therapy. Both thiopental and pentobarbital undergo oxidation on the terminal carbon atom of the 1-methyl-butyl side chain in the course of metabolic transformation and leads to thiopental carboxylic acid and pentobarbital carboxylic acid, which are pharmacologically inactive. A second metabolic pathway leads to thiopental alcohol and pentobarbital alcohol (metabolites without activity) by hydroxylation in position 3 of the methyl-butyl side chain. Oxidation to the thiopental carboxilic acid is the major step of detoxification in humans, and the urinary excretion of this product accounted for about 10 to 25% of the administered doses. It seems that the main determining factor in the metabolism rate is not the activity of the microcomal enzyme systems but the slow thiopental release from fat deposits. <br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental. Russo H, Bressolle F. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998 Aug;35(2):95-134</em></p>
<p>The isoenzymes of thiopental metabolism have not been identified, but barbiturates are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP), specifically the 2B and 2C families, in rats. CYP3A3 and CYP3A4 can be induced by barbiturates in humans. Pentobarbital is formed to a significant extent when thiopental is given at high doses for several days. Pentobarbital is a potent inducer of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism. The increase in pentobarbital clearance (from 0.047 to 0.079 L/h/kg) by autoinduction in patients treated for reduction of intracranial pressure, became apparent after 6 to 7 days of drug exposure. However, for pentobarbital as a metabolite, concentrations are far below the therapeutic range (15 to 40 mg/L). Pretreatment with enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or enzyme inhibitor (ethionine) did not modify the sleeptime after thiopental injection in rats. Thus, thiopental action is not limited by metabolism breakdown. Increasing the metabolism of thiopental by phenobarbital injection (pretreatment for 8 days) reduced the period of depression in cattle, but had no effect on the duration of surgical anaesthesia.<br /><em>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of thiopental.

                    <span><p>An in vitro study identified four timolol metabolites, the most abundant being a hydroxy metabolite, M1. Metabolism of timolol with recombinant P450s and correlation analysis confirmed that the drug is metabolized principally by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 being only a minor contributor (&lt;10%) to the intrinsic microsomal clearance. The CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine proved a potent competitive inhibitor of timolol metabolism, with an in vitro K(i) value of 0.08 microM. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, inhibited timolol metabolism to a lesser extent, confirming its minor contribution. Timolol itself did not inhibit CYP2D6-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation. Judging from the disappearance of timolol in human liver homogenate, the in vivo half-life was extrapolated to be about 3 h, an estimate close to the half-life of about 2 to 5 h observed in vivo. The inhibition of timolol metabolism by quinidine should be taken into account when patients are treated with timolol. However, when plasma timolol concentrations in patients remain low (&lt; or = 0.2 microg/l), it is suggested that such interaction is of minor clinical relevance.<br /><em>Volotinen M, Turpeinen M, Tolonen A et al.

<p>Coadministration of tipranavir SEDDS (self-emulsifying drug delivery capsules) with ritonavir was investigated in a 14-day, open-label, multicentre phase II study. Patients were randomised to receive tipranavir alone (1200 mg twice daily), tipranavir (300 mg twice daily, n=10) with ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, n=10) or tipranavir (1200 mg twice daily, n=11) with ritonavir (200 mg twice daily). Median tipranavir trough concentrations were 0.803 &#181;M (tipranavir-1200 mg twice daily), 19.2 &#181;M (tipranavir/ritonavir 300/200 mg twice dally) and 56.1 &#181;M (tipranavir/ritonavir 1200/200 mg twice daily).

<p>Studies were conducted in HIV- subjects to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction between tipranavir and ritonavir.

In a second study ritonavir was added in a stepwise fashion from 100-500 mg to tipranavir 600 mg bd (n=7) and tipranavir 900 mg bd (n=6). The effect of ritonavir on tipranavir concentrations was dose related. Ritonavir 100 mg or 500 mg, given with tipranavir 600 mg increased tipranavir Cmax by 5- and 7-fold and increased Cmin by 9- and 40-fold respectively.

Hepatic elimination involves mainly non-enzymatic hydrolysis and, to a minor extent, CYP mediated N-demethylation as well as glucuronidation. Renal elimination is by both active secretion (mainly via OAT3) and glomerular filtration. Topotecan is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors has been shown to increase topotecan exposure. Coadministration could potentially increase topotecan exposure due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP and thus increase the risk and severity of topotecan-related side effects.</span>

<p>The effect of ritonavir (200 mg 12 hourly, 4 doses) on triazolam (0.125 mg) was evaluated in six healthy volunteers. Ritonavir produced a large and highly significant increase in triazolam Cmax, an increase in AUC, prolongation of elimination half-life and decreased clearance to less than 4% when compared to control values. The increased plasma concentration of triazolam were accompanied by enhanced pharmacodynamic activity of triazolam. Therefore, initial exposure to ritonavir in triazolam-treated patients will in fact increase the potential for excessive sedative effects and cautions regarding possible hazards of this combination appear to be warranted. <br /><em>Differential impairment of triazolam and zolpidem clearance by ritonavir.

In vitro, triclabendazole and its active sulfoxide metabolite are inhibitors of CYP3A4, and therefore may result in increased ritonavir plasma concentrations. However, due to short term dosing of triclabendazole, the effect on antiretrovirals is likely to be minimal. In vitro data show that ketoconazole, a CYP450 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of triclabendazole. As ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes, there is potential to increase levels of triclabendazole if co-administered, however the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.</span>

                    <span><p>Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, varenicline has no clinically meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of varneicline or co-administered medicinal products listed below is recommended. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. <br /><em>Champix Summary of Product Characteristics, Pfizer Ltd, August 2008.</em></p>
<p>No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 &gt;6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter, OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 may not require a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline and therefore a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. <br /><em>Chantix Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, May 2008.</em></p></span>

                    <span><p>In man, urine recovery of vecuronium varies from 3 to 35% within 24 hours. Data derived from patients requiring insertion of a T-tube in the common bile duct suggests that 25 to 50% of a total intravenous dose of vecuronium may be excreted in bile within 42 hours. Only unchanged vecuronium has been detected in human plasma following use during surgery. In addition, one metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been rarely detected in human plasma following prolonged clinical use in intensive care units. The 3-desacetyl vecuronium metabolite has been recovered in the urine of some patients in quantities that account for up to 10% of injected dose; 3-desacetyl vecuronium has also been recovered by T-tube in some patients, accounting for up to 25% of the injected dose.<br /><em>Vecuronium bromide for injection US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, updated February 2011</em></p>
<p>The metabolic fate of vecuronium bromide in humans has not been fully characterized. In vitro, vecuronium undergoes spontaneous deacetylation to form the hydroxy derivatives. The neuromuscular blocking activity of the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative appears to be at least 50% that of the unchanged drug. In vitro, the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative undergoes rapid conversion to the 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivative. The 17&#946;-hydroxy and 3&#945;,17&#946;-dihydroxy derivatives appear to have about 5 and 2% of the neuromuscular blocking activity of the unchanged drug respectively. The extent of spontaneous deacetylation and/or metabolism of vecuronium in humans remains to be clearly determined. Vecuronium bromide and its metabolite(s) appear to be excreted principally in feces via biliary elimination; the drug and its metabolite(s) are also excreted in urine. Although only unchanged drug has been detected in plasma in patients receiving the drug as an adjunct to surgical anesthesia, up to 10% of a dose of vecuronium bromide has been excreted in urine and 5&#8211;25% in bile as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative in some patients. Another metabolite, 3-desacetyl vecuronium, has been detected rarely in plasma following prolonged clinical use of the drug in an intensive care setting. Approximately 20&#8211;30% (range: 3&#8211;36%) of an IV dose of vecuronium bromide is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration in humans, principally as unchanged drug and to a lesser extent as the 3&#945;-hydroxy derivative. In patients with a T-tube in the common bile duct, 12&#8211;45% of an IV dose of vecuronium was reportedly excreted in bile within 18&#8211;42 hours after administration, almost completely as unchanged drug. <br /><em>AHFS Drug Information (via Medicines Complete), published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc, January 2009</em></p></span>

<p>Voriconazole is contraindicated with ritonavir doses of 400 mg every 12 h or greater. Coadministration of voriconazole with ritonavir 400 mg every 12 hours significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations and may lead to loss of antifungal response. Coadministration of voriconazole (400 mg twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 days) and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily for 9 days) resulted in no change in ritonavir AUC or Cmax; however voriconazole AUC and Cmax decreased by 82% and 66%, respectively. Coadministration of voriconazole and ritonavir 100 mg should be avoided unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole and ritonavir were determined in 2 groups of HIV- subjects (n=17 per group) receiving voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) and low or high dose ritonavir (100 or 400 mg twice daily). High dose ritonavir substantially decreased voriconazole AUC (82%) and Cmax (66%); the effect of low dose ritonavir was less pronounced with AUC decreasing by 39% and Cmax by 24%. Two subjects (one per group) experienced increases in voriconazole exposure (2.5-3-fold) which the authors suggest were due to lack of CYP2C19. Voriconazole had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetics of high dose ritonavir, but significantly decreased the AUC (14%) and Cmax (24%) of low dose ritonavir. Coadministration with high dose ritonavir is contraindicated due to the significant decrease in voriconazole exposure. Coadministration with low dose ritonavir should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient justifies the use. <br /><em>Steady state pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of voriconazole and ritonavir in healthy male subjects.

Induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 lead to decreased levels of R-warfarin while little pharmacokinetic effect is noted on S- warfarin when co-administered with ritonavir. Decreased R-warfarin levels may lead to reduced anticoagulation, therefore it is recommended that anticoagulation parameters are monitored when warfarin is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. <br /><em>Norvir Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, April 2012.</em></p>
<p>The coadministration of ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours for 12 days) and a single 5 mg dose of warfarin was investigated in 12 subjects. S-warfarin AUC was increased by 9% and the Cmax decreased by 9%. The AUC for the R-enantiomer was decreased by 33% and the Cmax unaltered with coadministration of ritonavir. Initial frequent monitoring of the INR during ritonavir and warfarin coadministration is indicated. <br /><em>Norvir Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, February 2012.</em></p>
<p>There is a case report where the warfarin dose had to be almost doubled to maintain INR whilst on ritonavir. When ritonavir was discontinued, the INR rose rapidly and the warfarin requirement decreased significantly. A potentiation of warfarin effect was expected when coadministered with ritonavir, however the opposite occurred. Frequent, careful monitoring of warfarin is recommended when coadministered with ritonavir.

<p>Coadministration of zidovudine (200 mg three times daily for 4 days) and ritonavir (300 mg four times daily) to 9 subjects resulted in a 25% decrease in zidovudine AUC and no change in ritonavir AUC.

Approximately two thirds of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is by reduction, with less than one third by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Coadministration could potentially increase ziprasidone concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4. Monitor side effects and decrease dosage if needed. Of note, the effect of ziprasidone on QT interval was not increased in presence of a metabolic inhibitor.
