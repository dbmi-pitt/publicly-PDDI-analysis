Adefovir		Aciclovir	DB00787	Coadministration has not been studied. Aciclovir is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine via active renal tubular secretion. Adefovir is excreted renally, by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Coadministration of adefovir with other medicinal products that are eliminated by tubular secretion or alter tubular function may increase serum concentrations of either adefovir or the co-administered medicinal product.

Adefovir		Alendronic acid	DB00630	Co-administration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. 	(See Summary)

Adefovir		Amphotericin B	DB00681	Caution is advised as co-administration of adefovir may increase serum concentrations of either drug via competition for renal excretion pathways or affecting renal function. Close monitoring of renal function is required. 	Caution is advised in patients receiving other medicinal products that may affect renal function or are excreted renally (e.g. cyclosporin and tacrolimus, intravenous aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, pentamidine, vancomycin, or medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human Organic Anion Transporter 1 (hOAT1), such as cidofovir). Co-administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil with medicinal products in these patients may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either adefovir or a co-administered medicinal product. The renal function of these patients should be closely monitored with a frequency tailored to the individual patient's medical condition.Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.

Adefovir		Ciclosporin		A pharmacokinetic interaction between adefovir and ciclosporin is considered unlikely. As ciclosporin can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended.	A clinical study in liver transplant patients has shown that no pharmacokinetic interaction occurs when adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily is administered concomitantly with tacrolimus. A pharmacokinetic interaction between adefovir and ciclosporin is also considered unlikely as ciclosporin shares the same metabolic pathway as tacrolimus. Nevertheless, given that tacrolimus and ciclosporin can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when either of these agents is coadministered with adefovir dipivoxil.Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.The effect of adefovir on ciclosporin concentrations is not known.Hepsera US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, October 2009.
Adefovir		Cidofovir	DB00369	Caution is advised as co-administration of adefovir may increase serum concentrations of either drug via competition for renal excretion pathways or affecting renal function. Close monitoring of renal function is required.	Caution is advised in patients receiving other medicinal products that may affect renal function or are excreted renally (e.g. cyclosporin and tacrolimus, intravenous aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, pentamidine, vancomycin, or medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human Organic Anion Transporter 1 (hOAT1), such as cidofovir). Co-administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil with medicinal products in these patients may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either adefovir or a co-administered medicinal product.

Adefovir		Cobicistat (with ATV or DRV)	DB09065	Coadministration has not been studied but based on the metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug-drug interaction is unlikely. Adefovir is eliminated renally via glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1 and cobicistat is unlikely to inhibit OATs at clinically relevant concentrations. Note, cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if adefovir requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.

Adefovir		Delavirdine	DB00705	In a pharmacokinetic substudy of a randomised clinical trial, delavirdine concentrations were reduced by approximately 50% in the delavirdine plus adefovir arms compared with the delavirdine arms. The AUC of adefovir was not significantly changed.	In a pharmacokinetic substudy of a randomized, partially double-blinded, multicenter study in a population of indinavir-experienced subjects with virologic failure (ACTG 884), 12-hour pharmacokinetics was conducted after 2 weeks administration of saquinavir/ritonavir with delavirdine (group A, n=6), adefovir dipivoxil (group B, n=7), or both (group C, n=5), and saquinavir plus nelfinavir with delavirdine (group D, n=7), adefovir dipivoxil (group E, n=6), or both (group F, n=6). Delavirdine concentrations were reduced by approximately 50%, in the delavirdine plus adefovir dipivoxil arms compared with the delavirdine arms. The AUC of adefovir dipivoxil were not significantly different among the different groups. This drug-drug interaction was not expected, the mechanism(s) is (are) not clear, and additional studies are warranted.Competing drug-drug interactions among multidrug antiretroviral regimens used in the treatment of HIV infected subjects: ACTG 884 Fletcher C, Acosta E, Cheng H et al.

Adefovir		Entecavir	DB00442	A pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction when adefovir and entecavir were co-administered. 	No pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and lamivudine, adefovir or tenofovir were observed.Baraclude Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, September 2010. Coadministration of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in significant drug interactions.Baraclude US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, October 2010. In a fixed-sequence crossover design in healthy adult subjects (n=26), subjects received 10 mg adefovir daily on days 1 to 4, 1 mg entecavir on days 5 to 14, and 1 mg entecavir plus 10 mg adefovir on days 15 to 24. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC, peak plasma concentration, and 24 hour post-dose plasma concentration of entecavir and adefovir were unchanged. Entecavir and adefovir were well tolerated when administered in combination. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic data generated in this study indicate that entecavir and adefovir can be coadministered without dose adjustment.Absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between entecavir and adefovir.  Bifano M, Yan Y-H, Smith R  et al.

Adefovir		Ibandronic acid		Co-administration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, ibandronic acid should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and before the first food or drink of the day. Medicinal products and supplements should be similarly avoided prior to taking ibandronic acid. Fasting should be continued for at least 30 minutes after taking ibandronic acid.	(See Summary)
Adefovir		Ibuprofen	DB01050	Adefovir did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen. Increases in adefovir Cmax (33%), AUC (23%) and urinary recovery were observed, no dose adjustment is recommended.	The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated following multiple dose administration of adefovir (10 mg once daily) in combination with ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily) in healthy volunteers (n=18). Adefovir did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen, however increases in adefovir Cmax (33%), AUC (23%) and urinary recovery were observed. This increase appears to be due to higher oral bioavailability, not a reduction in renal clearance of adefovir. The clinical significance of this increase in adefovir exposure is unknown and no dose adjustment is recommended.Hepsera US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, October 2009.

In a pharmacokinetic substudy of a randomized, partially double-blinded, multicenter study in a population of indinavir-experienced subjects with virologic failure (ACTG 884), 12-hour pharmacokinetics was conducted after 2 weeks administration of saquinavir/ritonavir with delavirdine (group A, n=6), adefovir dipivoxil (group B, n=7), or both (group C, n=5), and saquinavir plus nelfinavir with delavirdine (group D, n=7), adefovir dipivoxil (group E, n=6), or both (group F, n=6).There were no statistically significant differences in the concentrations of ritonavir or nelfinavir across the arms that included delavirdine, adefovir dipivoxil, or both; however, the numeric values of the ritonavir and nelfinavir AUC were lower in the adefovir dipivoxil arm. The AUC of adefovir dipivoxil were not significantly different among the different groups.Competing drug-drug interactions among multidrug antiretroviral regimens used in the treatment of HIV infected subjects: ACTG 884 Fletcher C, Acosta E, Cheng H et al.

In a pharmacokinetic substudy of a randomized, partially double-blinded, multicenter study in a population of indinavir-experienced subjects with virologic failure (ACTG 884), 12-hour pharmacokinetics was conducted after 2 weeks administration of saquinavir/ritonavir with delavirdine (group A, n=6), adefovir dipivoxil (group B, n=7), or both (group C, n=5), and saquinavir plus nelfinavir with delavirdine (group D, n=7), adefovir dipivoxil (group E, n=6), or both (group F, n=6).There was no statistically significant difference in the concentration of ritonavir across the arms that included delavirdine, adefovir dipivoxil, or both; however, the numeric values of the ritonavir AUC were lower in the adefovir dipivoxil arm. The AUC of adefovir dipivoxil was not significantly different among the different groups.Competing drug-drug interactions among multidrug antiretroviral regimens used in the treatment of HIV infected subjects: ACTG 884 Fletcher C, Acosta E, Cheng H et al.

As tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended.	A clinical study in liver transplant patients has shown that no pharmacokinetic interaction occurs when adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily is administered concomitantly with tacrolimus. Nevertheless, given that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when tacrolimus is coadministered with adefovir dipivoxil.Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have also been evaluated in post-liver transplantation patients following multiple dose administration of adefovir (10 mg once daily) in combination with tacrolimus (n=16). The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus were unchanged, as were the pharmacokinetics of adefovir (based on cross-study comparison).Hepsera US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, October 2009.Non-HBV-infected post-transplant recipients (n=16) with stable hepatic and renal function on a stable daily dose of tacrolimus (2-10 mg total daily dose) were studied before and after co-administration of adefovir 10 mg daily for 14 days. The AUC, Cmax and median elimination half-life of tacrolimus were not significantly altered by co-administration of adefovir.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Acamprosate	DB00659	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acamprosate does not undergo significant metabolism.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Acarbose	DB00284	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. After ingestion of acarbose, the majority of active unchanged drug remains in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to exert its pharmacological activity and is metabolised by intestinal enzymes and by the microbial flora.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Acebutolol	DB01193	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acebutolol is mainly excreted in the urine as the diacetol metabolite which is not mediated by CYP450. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Acenocoumarol	DB01418	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Acenocoumarol is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, but these enzymes are not affected by boceprevir.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Acetazolamide	DB00819	Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as acetazolamide is excreted unchanged in the urine.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Aciclovir	DB00787	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic is unlikely as aciclovir is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine via active renal tubular secretion.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Acitretin	DB00459	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Adefovir		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adefovir undergoes renal excretion and does not affect any of the CYP isoforms.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Agomelatine	DB06594	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatine is metabolised predominantly via CYP1A2. Note, agomelatine is contraindicated in hepatic impairment as increases in exposure of up to 140-times have been seen in cirrhotic patients.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Albendazole	DB00518	Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in the formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Boceprevir could potentially reduce albendazole sulfoxidation and thus lower the clinical effect of albendazole. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Albiglutide	DB09043	Coadministration has not been studied. Albiglutide delays gastric emptying and therefore may affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. The clinical effect of this is unknown.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Alendronic acid	DB00630	Co-administration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Alfentanil	DB00802	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase alfentanil concentrations as it is a substrate of CYP3A4.  Inhibition of alfentanil metabolism by boceprevir could increase the risk of prolonged or delayed respiratory depression. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir exposure is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Alfuzosin	DB00346	Coadministration is contraindicated as boceprevir, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, may increase concentrations of alfuzosin which can result in hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias. 	Coadministration is contraindicated as boceprevir may increase concentrations of alfuzosin which can result in hypotension.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Aliskiren	DB09026	Coadministration has not been studied. Boceprevir is a moderate inhibitor of P-gp and coadministration is likely to increase aliskiren concentrations resulting in increased side effects including hypotension. Caution is advised if aliskiren is coadministered with moderate P-gp inhibitors	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Allopurinol	DB00437	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Allopurinol is metabolised by xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase which are not affected by boceprevir. However, both allopurinol and boceprevir can cause leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia so these parameters should be monitored. Note, the European SPC and US Prescribing Information for allopurinol recommend reduced dose in hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Almotriptan	DB00918	Coadministration has not been studied. Almotriptan is partly eliminated unchanged in the urine and partly metabolized (mainly via monoamine oxidase-A and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and flavin monooxygenase). Although coadministration may increase almotriptan concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir, this is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Almotriptan is unlikely to affect boceprevir concentrations.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Aloe vera		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aloe vera is only a weak inhibitor of CYPs in vitro and therefore is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions. It does not inhibit P-gp and there is no evidence to suggest it impacts UGTs.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Alogliptin	DB06203	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Alogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism and is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine and metabolism by CYPs is minimal. No transporter interactions have been described.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Alprazolam	DB00404	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase alprazolam concentrations via inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir. Monitor closely for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. A lower dose of alprazolam should be considered. 	Coadministration of intravenous alprazolam has not been studied. Close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised during co-administration of boceprevir with intravenous benzodiazepines (alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam). Dose adjustment of the benzodiazepine should be considered.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd,  September 2013.Coadministration may increase alprazolam concentrations. Close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised during coadministration of boceprevir. A lower dose of alprazolam should be considered.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc,  September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Aluminium hydroxide		Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Alverine citrate		Coadministration has not been studied but based on limited understanding of metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. However as alverine citrate affects gastric motility, an effect on the absorption of boceprevir cannot be ruled out. Doses of boceprevir and alverine should be separated by 4 hours if possible.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Amantadine	DB00915	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as amantadine is only metabolised to a minor extent (principally by N-acetylation) and largely excreted unchanged in urine.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Ambrisentan	DB06403	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase ambrisentan concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp by boceprevir. The clinical significance of this is unknown and in the absence of further data, monitor for increased ambrisentan side effects.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Amikacin	DB00479	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Amikacin is predominantly eliminated unchanged via renal pathways.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Amiloride	DB00594	Coadministration has not been studied but based on lack of metabolism of amiloride a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Amiodarone	DB01118	Coadministration has not been studied. Both amiodarone and boceprevir are inhibitors of CYP3A4, therefore, both concentrations may increase. As boceprevir is a more potent inhibitor, increased concentrations of amiodarone may be more likely and produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events. Use with extreme caution and monitor concentrations of amiodarone.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Atazanavir	DB01072	Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 35%, 25%, and 49%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC decreased by 34%, but coadministration did not alter boceprevir AUC. Coadministration is not recommended in the boceprevir US Prescribing Information, but the European SPCs for boceprevir and atazanavir state it can be considered on a case by case basis if deemed necessary in patients with suppressed HIV viral loads and without any suspected viral resistance to the HIV regimen. Coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat has not been studied and is not recommended.	Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) had no effect on boceprevir AUC, Cmax or Cmin (changes of 5%, 7% and 18%, respectively.  Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 35%, 25% and 49%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 36%, 27% and 45%, respectively. Co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir with boceprevir resulted in lower exposure of atazanavir which may be associated with lower efficacy and loss of HIV control. This co-administration might be considered on a case by case basis if deemed necessary, in patients with suppressed HIV viral loads and with HIV viral strain without any suspected resistance to the HIV regimen. Increased clinical and laboratory monitoring for HIV suppression is warranted.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd,  September 2013.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, April 2012. Concomitant administration of boceprevir and atazanavir/ritonavir resulted in reduced steady-state exposures to atazanavir and ritonavir.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Atorvastatin	DB01076	Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) and atorvastatin (40 mg single dose) increased atorvastatin AUC and Cmax by 130% and 170% respectively. Atorvastatin had no significant effect on boceprevir pharmacokinetics. When starting atorvastatin, start with the lowest possible dose and titrate up to desired clinical effect while monitoring for safety. The European SPC recommends a maximum daily dose of 20 mg, whereas the US Prescribing Information recommends a maximum daily dose of 40 mg.	Exposure to atorvastatin was increased when administered with boceprevir. Coadministration of atorvastatin (40 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased atorvastatin AUC and Cmax by 130% and 166%, respectively. Boceprevir AUC decreased by 5%, but Cmax increased by 4%. When co-administration is required, starting with the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be considered with titration up to desired clinical effect while monitoring for safety, without exceeding a daily dose of 20 mg. For patients currently taking atorvastatin, the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed a daily dose of 20 mg during co-administration with boceprevir.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013.Exposure to atorvastatin was increased when administered with boceprevir. Coadministration of atorvastatin (40 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) increased atorvastatin Cmax by 2.66-fold and AUC by 2.30-fold. The Cmax of boceprevir increased by 4% and AUC decreased by 5%. Use the lowest effective dose of atorvastatin, but do not exceed a daily dose of 40 mg when coadministered with boceprevir.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.  The effect of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) on single doses of atorvastatin (40 mg)  was investigated 10 HCV-negative subjects.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Captopril	DB01197	Coadministration has not been studied, based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as captopril is largely excreted in the urine (40-50% as unchanged drug, the rest as disulfide and other metabolites).	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Carbamazepine	DB00564	Coadministration is contraindicated. Induction of CYP3A4 by carbamazepine may significantly reduce the plasma exposure of boceprevir  which could lead to loss of virological response to boceprevir. 	The concomitant use of boceprevir with anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine) may significantly reduce the plasma exposure of boceprevir. No data are available, therefore, the combination of boceprevir with these medicines is not recommended.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd,  September 2013. Coadministration is contraindicated as it may lead to loss of virological response to boceprevir.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc,  September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Carbidopa	DB00190	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carbidopa is partly metabolized and partly eliminated unchanged (30% of the total urinary excretion).	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Carbimazole	DB00389	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Carbimazole is a pro-drug which undergoes rapid and virtually complete metabolism to the active metabolite, thiamazole (also known as methimazole).

Boceprevir	DB08873	Carvedilol	DB01136	Coadministration has not been studied. As both carvedilol and boceprevir are inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, concentrations of both may be increased. Carvedilol can also commonly cause anaemia. Monitor for increased side effects and toxicities including anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for boceprevir and dizziness, bradycardia and GI upset for carvedilol. note, the US Prescribing Information contraindicates carvedilol in patients with severe liver impairment and the European SPC contraindicates it in patients with hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Caspofungin	DB00520	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as caspofungin undergoes spontaneous chemical degradation and non-CYP medicated metabolism. Note, no dose adjustment is required in patients with normal hepatic function but a dose reduction of caspofungin daily dose to 35 mg is recommended for adults with moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in adults with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)

Boceprevir	DB08873	Celecoxib	DB00482	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Celecoxib is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 with CY 3A4 being involved to a lesser extent. Boceprevir is not a substrate or inhibitor of CYP2C9 and so a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However, celecoxib may uncommonly cause anaemia which may be exacerbated by boceprevir. Note, use in patients with severe liver impairment is contraindicated in the European SPC and not recommended in the US Prescribing Information. In patients with moderate liver impairment (serum albumin 25-35 g/L, Child-Pugh Class B), celecoxib treatment should be started at half the recommended dose.	(See Summary)

Boceprevir	DB08873	Chloramphenicol	DB00446	Coadministration has not been studied. Chloramphenicol inhibits CYP3A4 In vitro and may potentially increase boceprevir concentrations, increasing the risk of adverse events. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Boceprevir, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, may increase concentrations of chloramphenicol and monitoring for haematological adverse effects is recommended.  Although chloramphenicol is systemically absorbed when used topically in the eye, the concentrations achieved are unlikely to cause a clinically significant interaction.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Chloroquine	DB00608	Co-administration has not been studied.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Chlorphenamine	DB01114	Coadministration has not been studied.  The metabolism of chlorphenamine has been poorly characterised, but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Chlorpromazine	DB00477	Coadministration with boceprevir has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as chlorpromazine is metabolised predominantly via CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2. Chlorpromazine can cause QT prolongation so if used in combination with boceprevir ECG monitoring should be performed to avoid risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Both chlorpromazine and boceprevir can cause neutropenia. Note, the European SPC for chlorpromazine advises that its use should be avoided in patients with hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Chlortalidone		Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as chlortalidone is largely excreted unchanged in the urine and faeces.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Ciclesonide	DB01410	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase ciclesonide concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression, have been reported in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and fluticasone and is likely with other corticosteroids metabolised by CYP3A4 such as ciclesonide. Coadministration is not recommended unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects and the patient should be monitored closely. A switch to a non-CYP3A4 metabolised glucocorticoid could be considered.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Ciclosporin		Coadministration of boceprevir and single doses of ciclosporin to HCV-negative subjects increased ciclosporin AUC and Cmax by 168% and 101%, respectively, but had no relevant effect on boceprevir pharmacokinetics. The magnitude of the potential interaction in organ transplant patients is not known, but could be higher and more variable than that seen in healthy volunteers. Dose adjustments of ciclosporin should be anticipated when administered with boceprevir and should be guided by close monitoring of ciclosporin blood concentrations, and frequent assessments of renal function and ciclosporin-related side effects.	Coadministration of cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg single dose) increased boceprevir AUC and Cmax by 16% and 8%. Coadministration of a single dose of cyclosporine (100 mg) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased cyclosporine AUC and Cmax by 168% and 101%, respectively. Dose adjustments of cyclosporine should be anticipated when administered with boceprevir and should be guided by close monitoring of cyclosporine blood concentrations, and frequent assessments of renal function and cyclosporine-related side effects. Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Dose adjustments of cyclosporine should be anticipated when administered with boceprevir and should be guided by close monitoring of cyclosporine blood concentrations, and frequent assessments of renal function and cyclosporine-related side effects. Coadministration of cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg single dose) increased boceprevir Cmax and AUC by 8% and 16%. When a single dose of cyclosporine (100 mg) was given following multiple doses of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days), the Cmax and AUC of cyclosporine increased by 2.01-fold and 2.68-fold.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.  The pharmacokinetic interaction between boceprevir and ciclosporin was investigated in a open-label, fixed sequence study in 10 HCV-negative subjects.  Single doses of ciclosporin (100 mg) and boceprevir (800 mg) were administered alone (days 1 and 2) or in combination (day 3). After a washout period, subjects received boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) for 7 days with a single dose of ciclosporin (100 mg) on day 6. Coadministration increased ciclosporin AUC and Cmax by 2.7-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively, but had no relevant effect on boceprevir pharmacokinetics. The magnitude of the potential interaction in organ transplant patients is not known, but could be higher and more variable than that seen in healthy volunteers.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Citalopram	DB00215	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Citalopram is only partially metabolised by CYP3A4 with 69% of metabolism occurring via CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Caution is warranted when coadministered with boceprevir as citalopram has been found to cause a dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Clarithromycin	DB01211	Coadministration may increase clarithromycin concentrations as both drugs are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4. The addition of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) to boceprevir (400 mg twice daily) and diflunisal (500 mg twice daily) increased boceprevir Cmax and AUC by 36% and 21%. No dosage adjustment is necessary with normal renal function. QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported with clarithromycin. In the event that co-administration is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended.	Concentrations of clarithromycin may be increased with boceprevir; however, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with normal renal function.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc,  September 2013.  The addition of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) to boceprevir (400 mg twice daily) and diflunisal (500 mg twice daily) was studied in 7 healthy subjects.  Boceprevir Cmax and AUC increased by 36% and 21%.Clinical pharmacology of boceprevir: metabolism, excretion, and drug-drug interactions.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Clomifene	DB00882	Coadministration has not been studied. Studies suggest clomiphene is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and UGTs and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Clomipramine	DB01242	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as clomipramine is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Clonazepam	DB01068	Coadministration has not been studied, but may increase clonazepam concentrations as clonazepam has been shown to be a CYP3A4 substrate in human and animal studies.	Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam. Klonopin Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, August 2010.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Clonidine	DB00575	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as ~70% administered clonidine is excreted in the urine, mainly in form of the unchanged parent drug (40-60% of the dose).	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Clopidogrel	DB00758	Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolites via CYPs 2C19, 3A4, 2B6, and 1A2. Boceprevir may decrease concentrations of the active metabolite and an alternative could be considered. Note, the European SPC for clopidogrel contraindicates clopidogrel in severe hepatic impairment but the US Prescribing Information states no dose alteration.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Clorazepate	DB00628	Coadministration has not been studied. Clorazepate is rapidly converted to nordiazepam which is then metabolized to oxazepam by CYP3A4. Boceprevir could potentially increase nordiazepam exposure via inhibition of CYP3A4 which could prolong sedation. Careful monitoring of patients with regard to sedative effects is warranted and a decrease in the dose of clorazepate may be required. Any dose adjustment made during boceprevir treatment should be re-evaluated after administration of boceprevir is completed.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Cloxacillin	DB01147	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Cobicistat (with ATV or DRV)	DB09065	This combination has not been studied and coadministration is not recommended. Based on drug-drug interactions studies with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, coadministration of boceprevir and atazanavir/cobicistat or darunavir/cobicistat may decrease atazanavir, darunavir or boceprevir concentrations.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Cocaine	DB00907	Coadministration has not been studied. Cocaine is metabolized by several pathways, with metabolism to norcocaine by CYP3A4 being less than 10% of the overall metabolic clearance. Boceprevir could potentially increase concentrations of the parent compound. The clinical relevance is unknown as cocaine is metabolized by other non-CYP mediated pathways. Ensure the patient is aware of signs/symptoms of cocaine toxicity. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Codeine	DB00318	Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data suggest that boceprevir may increase codeine concentrations via inhibition of CYP3A4, although CYP2D6 is also involved in the metabolic process.	Since the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes play a major role in the metabolism of codeine, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 activity may cause decreased clearance of codeine which could lead to an increase in codeine plasma concentrations. If coadministration with codeine sulfate is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. Codeine Sulphate Prescribing Information, Roxane, June 2011.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Colchicine	DB01394	Significant increases in colchicine levels are expected; fatal colchicine toxicity has been reported with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with boceprevir as it is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. See boceprevir prescribing information for details of dosing in the treatment and prophylaxis of gout flares and the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever.	Significant increases in colchicine levels are expected; fatal colchicine toxicity has been reported with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with boceprevir. For treatment of gout flares (during treatment with boceprevir): 0.6 mg (1 tablet) x 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Dose to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. For prophylaxis of gout flares (during treatment with boceprevir): if the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, reduce dose to 0.3 mg once a day; if the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, reduce the dose to 0.3 mg once every other day. For treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (during treatment with boceprevir a maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (maybe given as 0.3 mg twice a day).Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc,  September 2013.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Conivaptan	DB00872	Coadministration has not been studied. Conivaptan is metabolized by CYP3A4 and ccoadministration is contraindicated with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as boceprevir. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased conivaptan AUC by 11-fold. Treatment with CYP3A substrates may be initiated no sooner than 1 week after the infusion of conivaptan has been completed.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Cyclobenzaprine	DB00924	Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclobenzaprine undergoes a complex metabolic process involving glucuronidation and several CYP enzymes including CYPs 3A4 and 1A2. Coadministration may increase cyclobenzaprine concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir, though the clinical significance of this is unknown. Monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Cytisine	DB09028	Coadministration has not been studied and the pharmacokinetics of cytisine in both human and animal studies have been very poorly described.

In the absence of data, patients should be clinically monitored.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dabigatran		Coadministration has not been studied. Boceprevir is a mild P-gp inhibitor in vivo and an increase in plasma concentrations of substrates of the P-gp efflux transporter, such as dabigatran, should be anticipated. No dose adjustment of dabigatran is recommended, but patients receiving dabigatran should be monitored appropriately. 	A clinical drug interaction study with digoxin demonstrated that boceprevir is a mild P-gp inhibitor in vivo. An increase in plasma concentrations of substrates of the P-gp efflux transporter, such as dabigatran, should be anticipated. No dose adjustment of dabigatran is recommended.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Dasatinib	DB01254	Coadministration is contraindicated as it may increase dasatinib concentrations which may be associated with serious and/or life-threatening events.	Boceprevir is contraindicated when co-administered with medicines that are highly dependent on CYP3A4/5 for clearance, and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Delavirdine	DB00705	Coadministration has not been studied but could potentially increase concentrations of boceprevir and/or delavirdine. Delavirdine is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4. Boceprevir is metabolized by aldoketoreductase and CYP3A and is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Desipramine	DB01151	Coadministration has not been studied. Desipramine is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6.  Based on the known metabolic pathway of desipramine, boceprevir is not expected to alter desipramine concentrations.  However the US Prescribing Information for boceprevir states to use with caution and to consider a lower dose of desipramine. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir exposure is unlikely. 	Plasma concentrations of desipramine may increase when administered with boceprevir, resulting in adverse events such as dizziness, hypotension and syncope. Use with caution and consider a lower dose of desipramine.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc,  September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Desloratidine		Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. The metabolism of desloratidine has been poorly characterised but no clinically relevant interactions have been observed with other inhibitors of CYP enzymes.	The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered. Neoclarityn Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2011.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Desmopressin	DB00035	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as desmopressin undergoes no significant metabolism.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Desogestrel	DB00304	Coadministration has not been studied. Desogestrel is a prodrug that requires activation to etonogestrel. Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration may increase the conversion to the active metabolite etonogestrel due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir. Caution should be used if coadministering a combined oral contraceptive. When used in combination with an estrogen containing product, concentrations of the estrogen component may decrease.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Desvenlafaxine	DB06700	Coadministration has not been studied. Desvenlafaxine is metabolised via CYP3A4 and concentrations may be increased via inhibition of this enzyme by boceprevir. A dose reduction of desvenlafaxine should be considered if appropriate. A maximum dose of 50 mg is recommended in moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dexamethasone	DB01234	Avoid coadministration if possible as it may decrease boceprevir concentrations (due to CYP3A4 induction by dexamethasone) which may result in loss of therapeutic effect. If coadministration is necessary, use with caution.	Coadministration of boceprevir with CYP3A4/5 inducers may decrease plasma concentrations of boceprevir, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect. Therefore, this combination should be avoided if possible and used with caution if necessary.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc,  September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dextromethorphan	DB00514	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as dextromethorphan is metabolized by CYP2D6 and boceprevir does not affect this enzyme.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dextropropoxyphene	DB00647	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn in most European and North American countries due to the risk of arrhythmias and fatal overdose. As it is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4, coadministration with boceprevir could potentially increase dextropropoxyphene exposure which could increase the risk of respiratory depression, arrhythmia and QT prolongation.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Diamorphine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as diamorphine is metabolised mainly by deacetylation.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Diazepam	DB00829	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of diazepam via inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir. Diazepam is metabolised to nordiazepam via CYP3A4 and 2C19 and then to temazepam predominantly by CYP3A4. Use with caution as there is an increased risk of prolonged sedation and respiratory depression.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Diclofenac	DB00586	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as diclofenac is metabolised by CYP2C9.	(See Summary)

Boceprevir	DB08873	Digoxin	DB00390	Coadministration of digoxin (0.25 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased digoxin AUC and Cmax by 19% and 18%, respectively. No a priori dose adjustment of digoxin or boceprevir is recommended, but measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating boceprevir and continue to monitor during coadministration.	A clinical drug interaction study with digoxin (0.25 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) demonstrated that boceprevir is a mild P-gp inhibitor in vivo, increasing digoxin AUC by 19% and increasing Cmax by 18%. This is likely due to an effect on P-gp transport in the gut. No dose adjustment of digoxin or boceprevir is recommended. Patients receiving digoxin should be monitored appropriately. Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd,  September 2013.  In a drug interaction trial conducted with digoxin, boceprevir had limited p-glycoprotein inhibitory potential at clinically relevant concentrations. Digoxin concentrations increased when administered with boceprevir. Coadministration of digoxin (0.25 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 10 days) increased digoxin Cmax and AUC by 18% and 19%, respectively. Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating boceprevir. Continue monitoring digoxin concentrations; consult the digoxin prescribing information for information on titrating the digoxin dose.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dihydroartemisinin		Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydroartemisinin may induce 3A4 and theoretically may decrease boceprevir concentrations. Monitor therapeutic effect. A clinically significant effect on dihydroartemisinin is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dihydrocodeine	DB01551	Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydrocodeine is converted to dihydromorphine (active metabolite) via CYP2D6, to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide via UGT2B7 (major pathway) and to nordihydrocodeine via CYP3A4. The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir may increase the analgesic effects of dihydrocodeine. Monitor the analgesic effect and for signs of opiate toxicity.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dihydroergotamine	DB00320	Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for acute ergot toxicity.

(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Drospirenone	DB01395	Note the difference in recommendations for the European SPC (caution, consider alternative contraceptive) and the US Prescribing Information (contraindicated due to potential for hyperkalaemia). The charts reflect the more cautious option. Coadministration of drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (3/0.02 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased drospirenone Cmax and AUC by 57% and 99%, but decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 24%; ethinylestradiol Cmax was unchanged. Systemic hormonal contraceptives may not be as effective in women while taking boceprevir. Women of childbearing potential and men must use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. One of these forms of contraception can be a combined oral contraceptive product containing at least 1 mg of norethindrone. Oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone and other forms of hormonal contraception have not been studied or are contraindicated.	Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol/drospirenone (0.02/3.0 mg once daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 24% and had no effect on Cmax. The AUC and Cmax of drospirenone increased by 57% and 99%.  Caution should be exercised in patients taking drospirenone-containing medicines with conditions that predispose them to hyperkalaemia. Alternative contraceptives should be considered.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Coadministration of boceprevir and drospirenone is contraindicated due to potential for hyperkalaemia.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Duloxetine	DB00476	Coadministration has not been studied. Duloxetine is metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Based on the known metabolic pathways boceprevir is not expected to alter duloxetine concentrations. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir exposure is unlikely. Note, duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment as concentrations may increase due to decreased clearance of duloxetine.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Dutasteride	DB01126	Coadministration has not been studied. Dutasteride is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and coadministration may increase dutasteride concentrations. Monitor for increased side effects such as impotence, decreased libido and dizziness. The European SPC for dutasteride suggests switching to 48 hourly dosing if side effects become problematic. Note, the European SPC (but not the US Prescribing Information) cautions against dutasteride use in mild to moderate hepatic impairment and contraindicates it in severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Echinacea		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and potent 3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter boceprevir exposure.	(See Summary)

Boceprevir	DB08873	Ethinylestradiol		Coadministration of drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (3/0.02 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased drospirenone Cmax and AUC by 57% and 99%, but decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 24%; ethinylestradiol Cmax was unchanged. Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol/norethindrone (0.035/1 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of ethinyl estradiol  by 26% and 21%, respectively. Norethindrone AUC and Cmax decreased by 4% and 17%, respectively.  Coadministration with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and at least 1 mg of norethindrone is unlikely to alter the contraceptive effectiveness, but the ovulation suppression activity of oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol and of other forms of hormonal contraception during co-administration with boceprevir has not been established.  Systemic hormonal contraceptives may not be as effective in women while taking boceprevir due to decreased concentration of ethinyl estradiol. Two alternative effective methods of contraception, including intrauterine devices and barrier methods, should be used in women during treatment with boceprevir and concomitant ribavirin. Patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of oestrogen deficiency.	Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol/drospirenone (0.02/3.0 mg once daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 24% and had no effect on Cmax. The AUC and Cmax of drospirenone increased by 57% and 99%.  Alternative contraceptives should be considered.Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol/norethindrone (0.035/1 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of ethinyl estradiol  by 26% and 21%, respectively. Norethindrone AUC and Cmax decreased by 4% and 17%, respectively.  Coadministration of boceprevir with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and at least 1 mg of norethindrone is unlikely to alter the contraceptive effectiveness. Indeed, serum progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels indicated that ovulation was suppressed during coadministration of norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg with boceprevir. The ovulation suppression activity of oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol and of other forms of hormonal contraception during co-administration with boceprevir has not been established. Patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of oestrogen deficiency.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Coadministration of drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (3/0.02 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased drospirenone Cmax and AUC by 57% and 99%, but decreased ethinylestradiol AUC by 24%; ethinylestradiol Cmax was unchanged.  Coadministration of norethindrone/ethinylestradiol (1/0.035 mg daily for 21 days) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 28 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of norethindrone by 17% and 4% and decreased those of ethinylestradiol by 21% and 26%. Coadministration of boceprevir with a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and at least 1 mg of norethindrone is not likely to alter the effectiveness of this combined oral contraceptive. Women of childbearing potential and men must use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. One of these forms of contraception can be a combined oral contraceptive product containing at least 1 mg of norethindrone. Oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone and other forms of hormonal contraception have not been studied or are contraindicated. Patients using estrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of estrogen deficiency.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013. Coadministration of drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (3/0.02 mg once daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) was studied in 16 healthy subjects.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Ethosuximide	DB00593	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of ethosuximide due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir, potentially causing an increase in CNS toxicities. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in ethosuximide dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Etoposide	DB00773	Coadministration has not been studied. Etoposide is partly metabolised by CYP3A4 to reactive catechol metabolites and partly metabolised by UGT1A1.  Concentrations of etoposide may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by boceprevir, increasing risk and severity of mucositis, myelosuppression and transaminitis. Use with caution.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Etoricoxib	DB01628	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Etoricoxib is metabolised by multiple CYP enzymes including CYP3A4 and although concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir, studies with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors have shown this is unlikely to be of clinical significance.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Etravirine	DB06414	Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg every 8 h) and etravirine (200 mg twice daily) decreased etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 23%, 24% and 29%, respectively.  Boceprevir AUC and Cmax both increased by 10%, but Cmin decreased by 12%. The clinical significance of the reductions in etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters and boceprevir Cmin in the setting of combination therapy with HIV antiretroviral medicines has not been directly assessed. Increased clinical and laboratory monitoring for HIV and HCV suppression is recommended. 	Coadministration of etravirine (200 mg every 12 hours) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased boceprevir AUC and Cmax both by 10%, but decreased Cmin by 12%. Etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 23%, 24% and 29% respectively. The clinical significance of the reductions in etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters and boceprevir Cmin in the setting of combination therapy with HIV antiretroviral medicines, which also affect the pharmacokinetics of etravirine and/or boceprevir, has not been directly assessed. Increased clinical and laboratory monitoring for HIV and HCV suppression is recommended. Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Concentrations of etravirine decreased when coadministered with boceprevir. Coadministration of etravirine (200 mg two times daily for 11-14 days) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 11-14 days) increased boceprevir Cmax and AUC both by 10%, but decreased Cmin by 12%. Etravirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 24%, 23% and 29%, respectively. The clinical significance of the reductions in etravirine pharmacokinetic parameters has not been directly assessed.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.  The steady state pharmacokinetic interaction between boceprevir (800 mg every 8 hours) and etravirine (200 mg twice daily) was studied in 20 HIV/HCV co-infected subjects.  Coadministration decreased etravirine AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 23%, 24% and 29%, respectively.  Boceprevir AUC and Cmax both increased by 10%, but C8h decreased by 12%.  These alterations in drug concentrations were not expected given both are CYP3A substrates and etravirine being a CYP3A inducer and boceprevir a CYP3A inhibitor.Pharmacokinetic interaction between boceprevir and etravirine in HIV/HCV seronegative volunteers.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Everolimus	DB01590	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp by boceprevir may increase everolimus concentrations. Concentrations of boceprevir may also increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by everolimus. If coadministration cannot be avoided, therapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus should be performed along with monitoring for boceprevir related side effects and toxicities. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Exemestane	DB00990	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Exemestane is metabolised by CYP3A4 but coadministration with ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) showed no clinically significant effects and no effect is expected due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir. No a priori dose adjustment is required.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Exenatide	DB01276	Coadministration with exenatide has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as exenatide is eliminated via glomerular filtration. However, as exenatide slows gastric emptying it is advisable to take boceprevir at least 1 hour before an exenatide injection.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Ezetimibe	DB00973	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Famotidine	DB00927	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as famotidine is not metabolised by cytochrome enzymes.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Felodipine	DB01023	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of felodipine due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir. Use with caution. Clinical monitoring is recommended.	Coadministration has not been studied but plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers may increase when administered with boceprevir due to inhibition of CYP3A. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Plasma concentrations of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may increase when administered with boceprevir. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Fenofibrate	DB01039	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as fenofibrate is metabolised by multiple enzyme pathways (esterases, UGT2B7 and UGT1A1). Note, fenofibrate is contraindicated in severe hepatic disease in its European SPC, and its US Prescribing Information contraindicates it in active liver disease.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Fentanyl	DB00813	Coadministration has not been studied but could increase fentanyl exposure which may increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects. Patients receiving fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted.	Fentanyl, a high clearance drug, is rapidly and extensively metabolised mainly by CYP3A4.  The concomitant use of fentanyl with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression. In this situation, special patient care and observation are appropriate. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and fentanyl is not recommended, unless the patient is closely monitored. Durogesic Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, April 2011.The concomitant use of fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted. Durogesic Prescribing Information, Janssen Pharms, July 2009.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Fexofenadine	DB00950	Coadministration has not been studied. As metabolism is negligible a significant interaction is unlikely. Fexofenadine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and boceprevir is an inhibitor of P-gp and theoretically may increase fexofenadine concentrations. Although this is unlikely to be clinically significant, monitoring for side effects is recommended.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Filgrastim	DB00099	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. CYP involvement has not been displayed with filgrastim and it is mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, such that the serum concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly with neutrophil recovery.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Finasteride	DB01216	Co-administration has not been studied. Finasteride is metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration may increase finasteride concentrations, However, any increase is unlikely to be of clinical significance due to finasteride’s wide margin of safety and no a priori dose alteration is recommended. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Fingolimod	DB08868	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Fish oils		Co-administration with omega-3 fish oils has not been studied. Although cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the hydroxylation of omega-3 there is no human data to indicate any clinical significance. Simultaneous coadministration with saquinavir (an HIV protease inhibitor) in rats increased saquinavir exposure by ~3-fold, but separating the doses by 2 h overcame the interaction.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Flecainide	DB01195	Coadministration has not been studied, but may increase flecainide concentrations and produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events arising from possible QT prolongation. Use with caution. Monitor concentrations of flecainide. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Flibanserin	DB04908	Coadministration has not been studied and is contraindicated. Flibanserin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir is expected to increase flibanserin concentrations which can cause severe hypotension and syncope.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Flucloxacillin	DB00301	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Flucloxacillin is mainly eliminated renally, partly by glomerular filtration and partly by active secretion via OAT1. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Fluconazole	DB00196	Coadministration has not been studied but could increase boceprevir or fluconazole exposure as both are inhibitors of CYP3A4 albeit boceprevir a more potent one (fluconazole shows moderate inhibition of CYP3A4). Caution should be exercised when using this combination and patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4-5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. 	Caution should be exercised when boceprevir is combined with azole antifungals.  Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, March 2012.Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 2C9 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. There is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4-5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Hydromorphone	DB00327	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Hydromorphone is extensively glucuronidated and excreted in the urine mainly as conjugated metabolites. Hydromorphone is a poor inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes and is not expected to alter boceprevir concentrations. Note, use of hydromorphone in patients with ANY degree of hepatic impairment is contraindicated in its European SPC, but the US Prescribing Information does not recommend it for patients with severe hepatic impairment and suggests a dose reduction for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Hydroxychloroquine	DB01611	Coadministration has not been studied. CYP3A4 is likely to have role in the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine.

Note, the European SPC for hydroxychloroquine recommends caution in impaired hepatic function.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Hydroxyzine	DB00557	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of hydroxyzine. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir exposure is unlikely. Note, as hydroxyzine elimination is impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction, daily dose or dose frequency should be reduced in patients with impaired liver function.	As hydroxyzine is metabolized in the liver, an increase in hydroxyzine blood concentrations may be expected when hydroxyzine is co-administered with other drugs known to be potent inhibitors of liver enzymes. The formation of the major metabolite cetirizine, a carboxylic acid metabolite (approximately 45% of the oral dose), is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. This metabolite has significant peripheral H1-antagonist properties. The other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated metabolite, and an O-dealkylated metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4/5. Hydroxyzine inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9/10, 2C19 and 3A4 isoforms at concentrations (IC50: 19 to 140 µM; 7 to 52 µg/ml) well above peak plasma concentrations. Therefore, hydroxyzine is unlikely to impair the metabolism of drugs which are substrates for these enzymes. The metabolite cetirizine at 100 µM has no inhibitory effect on human liver cytochrome P450 (1A2, 2A6, 2C9/C10, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) and UDP-glucuronyl transferase isoforms. As hydroxyzine elimination is impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction, daily dose or dose frequency should be reduced in patients with impaired liver function.Ucerax Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Ltd, August 2010.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Ketoprofen	DB01009	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ketoprofen is mainly glucuronidated and there is no evidence that boceprevir inhibits or induces UGTs.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Labetalol	DB00598	Coadministration has not been studied, but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.  Minimal information exists on metabolism of labetalol but it is thought to be mainly through conjugation to glucuronides. As there is significant first pass metabolism in the liver, consider monitoring for potential increased side effects when coadministered with boceprevir.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lacidipine	DB09236	Coadministration has not been studied. Lacidipine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration may increase lacidipine concentrations. Caution is advised and dose titration may be required. Both medications may prolong the QT interval and ECG monitoring should be considered. Note, caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lacosamide	DB06218	Coadministration has not been studied. Lacosamide is metabolised by CYP3A4 and caution is recommended with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as boceprevir which may increase systemic exposure of lacosamide. Monitor for increased side effects.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lactulose	DB00581	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of lactulose to lactic acid occurs via gastro-intestinal microbial flora only.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lamivudine	DB00709	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as lamivudine is not metabolised via CYP enzymatic pathways.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as lamivudine is not metabolised via CYP enzymatic pathways.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lamotrigine	DB00555	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Lamotrigine is metabolised by UDP-glucuronyl transferases and there is no evidence that it causes clinically significant induction or inhibition of hepatic oxidative drug-metabolising enzymes. 	UDP-glucuronyl transferases have been identified as the enzymes responsible for metabolism of lamotrigine.  There is no evidence that lamotrigine causes clinically significant induction or inhibition of hepatic oxidative drug-metabolising enzymes, and interactions between lamotrigine and medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely to occur.Lamictal Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, July 2011.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lanreotide	DB06791	Coadministration has not been studied. The limited data available indicate the somatostatin analogues, such as lanreotide, may increase concentrations of cytochrome P450 substrates such as boceprevir. As a possible interaction cannot be excluded, it is recommended if coadministered to monitor for excess side effects and to adjust the dose if appropriate.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lansoprazole	DB00448	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of boceprevir through inhibition of CYP3A4. Lansoprazole is partly metabolised by CYP3A4. It is unclear whether inhibition of this pathway by boceprevir would result in a clinically significant interaction. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lapatinib	DB01259	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Concentrations of lapatinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition by boceprevir. If coadministration is unavoidable, a dose decrease of lapatinib will be required. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Coadministration with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has not been studied and is not recommended.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lercanidipine	DB00528	Coadministration has not been studied but is likely to lead to a substantial increase in lercanidipine concentrations.  Coadministration of lercanidipine with strong inhibitors or CYP3A4 is contraindicated.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Letrozole	DB01006	Coadministration has not been studied. Letrozole is metabolised via CYP3A4 and concentrations may be increased via inhibition of this enzyme by boceprevir. Patients should be monitored for increased side effects if these drugs are coadministered. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Levetiracetam	DB01202	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.  Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans and production of the primary metabolite is not mediated by liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.	Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. Production of the primary metabolite is not supported by liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  In vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl transferase (UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities.  Levetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and in vivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme induction is expected in vivo. Therefore, the interaction of Keppra with other substances, or vice versa, is unlikely. Keppra Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Ltd, October 2011.In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes.Keppra Prescribing Information, UCB Inc, December 2011.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Levocetirizine	DB06282	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as less than 14% of a dose of levocetirizine is metabolised.	The extent of metabolism of levocetirizine in humans is less than 14% of the dose. Due to its low metabolism and absence of metabolic inhibition potential, the interaction of levocetirizine with other substances, or vice-versa, is unlikely. No interaction studies have been performed with levocetirizine (including no studies with CYP3A4 inducers); studies with the racemate compound cetirizine demonstrated that there were no clinically relevant adverse interactions.Xyzal Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Ltd, December 2010.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Levofloxacin	DB01137	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as levofloxacin is metabolised to a very small extent. However, levofloxacin may cause QT prolongation - caution and potentially ECG monitoring may be required if coadministered with boceprevir.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Levomepromazine		Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as levomepromazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. However, caution is advised if levomepromazine is coadministered with drug(s) liable to prolong the QT interval and ECG monitoring is recommended.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Levothyroxine	DB00451	Co-administration has not been studied and thyroid metabolism is complicated. The major pathway is sequential deiodination (but there are few published data on the enzymes involved) and conjugation with glucuronides and sulphates also occurs.  A few individual case reports indicate some potential CYP involvement but this is unlikely to be clinically significant. However, boceprevir can ‘commonly’ cause hypothyroidism and thyroid function should be monitored whilst on treatment. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lidocaine (Lignocaine)	DB00281	Coadministration has not been studied, but may increase lidocaine concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A4 and produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events. Use with caution. Clinical monitoring is recommended. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir concentrations is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Linaclotide	DB08890	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linaclotide is metabolised locally within the gastrointestinal tract and extensive studies have shown no CYP or transporter interactions occur.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Linagliptin	DB08882	Coadministration has not been studied. Linagliptin is a substrate of and mild to moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. However, data with ritonavir (a potent 3A4/P-gp inhibitor) indicate that despite an increase in linagliptin exposure, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors due to the large safety window of linagliptin.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Linezolid	DB00601	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.  Linezolid is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and it does not inhibit any of the clinically significant human CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4).	Linezolid is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system and it does not inhibit any of the clinically significant human CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Similarly, linezolid does not induce P450 isoenzymes in rats. Therefore, no CYP450-induced drug interactions are expected with linezolid.  The pharmacokinetics of linezolid in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (i.e. Child-Pugh class C) have not been evaluated. However, as linezolid is metabolised by a non-enzymatic process, impairment of hepatic function would not be expected to significantly alter its metabolism.Zyvox Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Ltd, July 2011.In vitro studies have demonstrated that linezolid is minimally metabolized and may be mediated by human cytochrome P450. However, the metabolic pathway of linezolid is not fully understood. Linezolid is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) in rats. In addition, linezolid does not inhibit the activities of clinically significant human CYP isoforms (e.g., 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Therefore, linezolid is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolized by these major enzymes.Zyvox Prescribing Information, Pharmacia & Upjohn, November 2011.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Liraglutide	DB06655	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Liraglutide is metabolised in a similar manner to large proteins with no specific organ having been identified as major route of elimination.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lisinopril	DB00722	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted entirely unchanged into the urine. Note, lisinopril exposure is increased in cirrhotic patients due to decreased clearance.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lithium	DB01356	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Lithium is excreted almost exclusively in the urine by the kidneys. Lithium should be avoided in patients concomitantly treated with drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lixisenatide	DB09265	Coadministration has not been studied. Lixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. However, delayed gastric emptying due to lixisenatide may reduce absorption of orally administered medicinal products. Boceprevir should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Loperamide	DB00836	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase loperamide concentrations. Loperamide is extensively metabolised in the liver and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Coadministration of loperamide with P-glycoprotein inhibitors (quinidine or ritonavir) increased loperamide concentrations by 2 to 3-fold . Coadministration of loperamide and ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein) increased loperamide concentrations by 5-fold. The clinical relevance of this is unknown. Note, use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment as no pharmacokinetic data are available and in such patients reduced first pass metabolism may result in a relative overdose leading to CNS toxicity.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Lopinavir	DB01601	Coadministration is not recommended. Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) decreased boceprevir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 45%, 50% and 57% respectively. Lopinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 34%, 30%, and 43%, respectively. Ritonavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 22%, 12% and 42%, respectively.	It is not recommended to co-administer lopinavir/ritonavir and boceprevir.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)	DB04829	Coadministration has not been studied. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is metabolized to O-H-LSD and N-desmethyl-LSD partly by CYP (unknown isoenzyme). Coadministration could potentially increase LSD concentrations. Ensure the patient is aware of signs/symptoms of LSD toxicity (i.e. hallucinations, agitation, psychosis, flashbacks).	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Macitentan	DB08932	Coadministration has not been studied. Macitentan is metabolised by CYP3A4 and caution is recommended with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 such as boceprevir as it is expected to increase macitentan concentrations. Monitor closely for side effects.	(See Summary)

Boceprevir	DB08873	Mefenamic acid	DB00784	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Mefenamic acid is metabolized by CYP2C9 and glucuronidated by UGTs 2B7 and 1A9.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Mefloquine	DB00358	Coadministration has not been studied. Mefloquine is metabolised via CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir may increase mefloquine concentrations and increase the potential risk of adverse reactions. In addition, both mefloquine and boceprevir are substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and concentrations of both may be increased although the clinical relevance of increases via this mechanism is uncertain. QT monitoring should be considered when CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as boceprevir are co-prescribed. Note, the use of mefloquine in patients with severe impairment of liver function is contraindicated in the European SPC for mefloquine, but not in the US Prescribing Information.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Melatonin	DB01065	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Melatonin is metabolised by CYP1A2 which is not affected by boceprevir.	(See Summary)

Boceprevir	DB08873	Methadone	DB00333	Coadministration of methadone (20-150 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of R-methadone by 15%, 10% and 19%, respectively and of  S-methadone by 22%, 17% and 26%, respectively. Boceprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 38% and 20%, but Cmin increased by 3%. These changes are not considered clinically relevant and no a priori dose adjustment of methadone or boceprevir is recommended. Individual patients may require additional titration of their methadone dosage when boceprevir is started or stopped to ensure clinical effect of methadone.  Caution should be exercised with medicines known to prolong the QT interval such as methadone.	Coadministration of methadone (20-150 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of R-methadone by 15%, 10% and 19%, respectively and of  S-methadone by 22%, 17% and 26%, respectively. Individual patients may require additional titration of their methadone  dosage when boceprevir is started or stopped to ensure clinical effect of  methadone. Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013.Plasma concentrations of R-methadone decreased when coadministered with boceprevir. Coadministration of methadone (20-150 mg daily for 6 days) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 6 days) decreased boceprevir Cmax and AUC by 38% and 20%, but increased Cmin by 3%. The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of R-methadone decreased by 10%, 15% and 19%, respectively, wherase those of S-methadone decreased by 17%, 22% and 26%, respectively. The observed changes are not considered clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of methadone or boceprevir is recommended.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Nitrofurantoin	DB00698	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Approximately 30-40% of a nitrofurantoin dose is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys, with a small proportion metabolized to aminofurantoin.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Norethisterone (Norethindrone)	DB00717	Coadministration of norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol (1/0.035 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of norethindrone by 4% and 17%, respectively. Ethinyl estradiol AUC and Cmax decreased by 26% and 21%, respectively. Coadministration with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and at least 1 mg of norethindrone is unlikely to alter the contraceptive effectiveness, but the ovulation suppression activity of oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol and of other forms of hormonal contraception during coadministration with boceprevir has not been established.	Coadministration of norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol (1/0.035 mg daily) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) decreased the AUC and Cmax of norethindrone by 4% and 17%, respectively. Ethinyl estradiol AUC and Cmax decreased by 26% and 21%, respectively. Coadministration of boceprevir with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and at least 1 mg of norethindrone is unlikely to alter the contraceptive effectiveness. Indeed, serum progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels indicated that ovulation was suppressed during coadministration of norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg with boceprevir. The ovulation suppression activity of oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol and of other forms of hormonal contraception during co-administration with boceprevir has not been established.Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Concentrations of  norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol decreased in the presence of boceprevir. Coadministration of norethindrone/ethinylestradiol (1/0.035 mg daily for 21 days) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 28 days) decreased the Cmax and AUC of norethindrone by 17% and 4% and decreased those of ethinylestradiol by 21% and 26%. Coadministration of boceprevir with a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and at least 1 mg of norethindrone is not likely to alter the effectiveness of this combined oral contraceptive. Women of childbearing potential and men must use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. One of these forms of contraception can be a combined oral contraceptive product containing at least 1 mg of norethindrone. Oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone and other forms of hormonal contraception have not been studied or are contraindicated.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Norfloxacin	DB01059	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as norfloxacin is excreted by the kidney and in the bile following partial metabolism by CYP1A2.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Ondansetron	DB00904	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Note, ondansetron clearance is significantly reduced and half-life significantly increased in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; in such patients a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded and parenteral or oral administration is recommended.	Ondansetron is metabolised by multiple hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes: CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 5% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Due to the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolising ondansetron, enzyme inhibition or reduced activity of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 genetic deficiency) is normally compensated by other enzymes and should result in little or no significant change in overall ondansetron clearance or dose requirement. Clearance of ondansetron is significantly reduced and serum half-life significantly prolonged in subjects with moderate or severe impairment of hepatic function. In such patients a total daily dose of 8mg should not be exceeded and therefore parenteral or oral administration is recommended.Zofran Summary of Product Characteristic, GlaxoSmithKline UK, February 2012.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Orlistat	DB01083	Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat is minimally absorbed after oral doses with about 97% of a dose excreted in the faeces, 83% of which as unchanged orlistat. A clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely, however, because of its effect on fat absorption in the GI tract, it cannot be ruled out that absorption of boceprevir could be reduced.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Orphenadrine	DB01173	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Orphenadrine is an inhibitor CYP2B6, but this enzyme is not involved in the metabolism of boceprevir.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Oseltamivir	DB00198	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Paroxetine	DB00715	Coadministration has not been studied. Paroxetine is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6 with a minor CYP3A4 component.  Boceprevir could potentially increase paroxetine concentrations to a small extent.  A clinically significant effect on boceprevir is unlikely.	The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes.  When paroxetine is to be co-administered with a known drug metabolising enzyme inhibitor, consideration should be given to using paroxetine doses at the lower end of the range. Seroxat Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, June 2010.The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes. An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics.  Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s in vitro Ki and its lack of effect on terfenadine’s in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.Paxil Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, August 2011.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Peg-IFN alfa		Boceprevir must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Coadministration of lower than recommended doses of boceprevir (200 or 400 mg three times daily) and pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG2b; 1.5 µg/kg/week) had no clinically relevant effect on boceprevir or PEG2b exposure and no dose adjustment is required.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Ranolazine	DB00243	Coadministration has not been studied. Coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated due to increased ranolazine concentrations and potential for serious adverse effects. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Rasagiline	DB01367	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic is unlikely as rasagiline is metabolised via CYP1A2 and to date there is no evidence of boceprevir involvement in this pathway.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Repaglinide	DB00912	Coadministration has not been studied. Repaglinide is metabolised mainly by CYP2C8 with CYP3A4 playing a minor role. Concentrations of repaglinide may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir. Clinical monitoring for increased side effects of repaglinide is recommended.	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Retigabine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Rifapentine	DB01201	Coadministration has not been studied but may decrease concentrations of boceprevir through induction of CYP3A4. Concentrations of rifapentine are unlikely to be altered. 	Rifapentine is an inducer of cytochromes P4503A4 and P4502C8/9. Therefore, rifapentine may increase the metabolism of other coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Induction of enzyme activities by rifapentine occurred within 4 days after the first dose. Enzyme activities returned to baseline levels 14 days after discontinuing rifapentine. In addition, the magnitude of enzyme induction by rifapentine was dose and dosing frequency dependent; less enzyme induction occurred when 600 mg oral doses of rifapentine were given once every 72 hours versus daily. In vitro and in vivo enzyme induction studies have suggested rifapentine induction potential may be less than rifampin but more potent than rifabutin.  Rifapentine does not induce its own metabolism.Priftin Prescribing Information, Sanofi-Aventis US, May 2010.
Boceprevir	DB08873	Rifaximin	DB01220	Coadministration has not been studied. Clinically significant drug interactions are not expected in patients with normal liver function. Rifaximin had no significant effect on midazolam, ethinylestradiol or norgestimate exposure in healthy subjects. It is unknown whether rifaximin will have a significant effect on CYP3A4 substrates in patients with elevated rifaximin concentrations, such as those with reduced liver function. Note, caution should be exercised when rifamixin is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.	Due to the negligible gastrointestinal absorption of orally administered rifaximin (less than 1%), the systemic drug interaction potential is low.  In vitro data show that rifaximin is a weak inducer of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the P450 cytochrome. Drug-drug interaction studies investigating the clinical interaction between rifaximin and drugs metabolised by the human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes demonstrated that rifaximin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Therefore, clinical interactions with drugs metabolised by these isoenzymes are not expected.  The potential for drug-drug interactions to occur at the level of gut transporter systems has not been evaluated and cannot be ruled out.Xifaxanta Summary of Product Characteristics, Norgine Limited, June 2011.In vitro studies have shown that rifaximin did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and CYP3A4 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng/mL. Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use. In an in vitro study, rifaximin was shown to induce CYP3A4 at the concentration of 0.2 μM. However, in patients with normal liver function, rifaximin at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4.  The effect of rifaximin on CYP3A4 in patients with impaired liver function who have elevated systemic exposure is not known. An in vitro study suggests that rifaximin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. In the presence of P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil, the efflux ratio of rifaximin was reduced greater than 50% in vitro. The effect of P-glycoprotein inhibition on rifaximin was not evaluated in vivo.  The inhibitory effect of rifaximin on P-gp transporter was observed in an in vitro study. The effect of rifaximin on P-gp transporter was not evaluated in vivo.Xifaxan Prescribing Information, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, November 2010.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Sorafenib	DB00398	Caution is advised as sorafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although no interaction was observed with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4), coadministration with boceprevir has not been studied. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir exposure is unlikely. Sorafenib has been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias.	Sorafenib is metabolised primarily in the liver and undergoes oxidative metabolism, mediated by CYP 3A4, as well as glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, administered once daily for 7 days to healthy male volunteers did not alter the mean AUC of a single 50 mg dose of sorafenib. These data suggest that clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of sorafenib with CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely. However caution is necessary.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Tacrolimus	DB00864	Coadministration of boceprevir and single doses of tacrolimus to HCV-negative subjects increased the AUC and Cmax of tacrolimus by ~17-fold and ~10-fold. The magnitude of the potential interaction in organ transplant patients is not known, but could be higher and more variable than that seen in healthy volunteers. Coadministration requires significant dose reduction and prolongation of the dosing interval of tacrolimus, with close monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and frequent assessments of renal function and tacrolimus-related side effects.	Coadministration of tacrolimus (0.5 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg single dose) had no effect on boceprevir AUC and decreased Cmax by 3%. Coadministration of a single dose of tacrolimus (0.5 mg) and boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) increased tacrolimus AUC and Cmax by 1610% and 890%, respectively. Concomitant administration of boceprevir with tacrolimus requires significant dose reduction and prolongation of the dosing interval of tacrolimus, with close monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and frequent assessments of renal function and tacrolimus-related side effects. Victrelis Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2013. Concomitant administration of boceprevir with tacrolimus requires significant dose reduction and prolongation of the dosing interval for tacrolimus, with close monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and frequent assessments of renal function and tacrolimus-related side effects. Coadministration of tacrolimus (0.5 mg single dose) and boceprevir (800 mg single dose) decreased boceprevir Cmax by 3% and had no effect on AUC. When a single dose of tacrolimus (0.5 mg) was given following multiple doses of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 11 days), the Cmax and AUC of tacrolimus increased by 9.9-fold and 17.1-fold.Victrelis Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, September 2013.The pharmacokinetic interaction between boceprevir and tacrolimus was investigated in a 2-part, open-label, fixed sequence study in HCV-negative subjects. In part A, 12 subjects received a single dose of tacrolimus (0.5 mg).  Following a washout period, they received boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) for 11 days with a single dose of tacrolimus (0.5 mg) on day 6.  In part B, 10 subjects received single doses of boceprevir (800 mg) alone and in combination with a single dose of tacrolimus (0.5 mg). Coadministration increased the AUC and Cmax of tacrolimus increased by 17-fold and 9.9-fold, respectively with no relevant effect on boceprevir pharmacokinetics. The magnitude of the potential interaction in organ transplant patients is not known, but could be higher and more variable than that seen in healthy volunteers.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Tamoxifen	DB00675	Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYP3A4 by boceprevir may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. 	(See Summary)
Boceprevir	DB08873	Tamsulosin	DB00706	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase tamsulosin concentrations. Tamsulosin is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Terbinafine	DB00857	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Terbinafine is metabolized by at least seven CYPs and the potential for interaction with other drugs is predicted to be low. Note, terbinafine in patients with chronic or active liver disease has not been studied in prospective clinical trials and therefore can not be recommended for such patients.	Terbinafine is rapidly metabolised by the CYP-isoenzymes, mainly by CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19.  The plasma clearance of terbinafine may be accelerated by drugs which induce metabolism (such as rifampicin) and may be inhibited by drugs which inhibit cytochrome P450 (such as cimetidine). Where co-administration of such drugs is required, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of terbinafine accordingly.  In vitro studies have shown, that terbinafine inhibits the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. Other in vitro and clinical studies suggest that terbinafine shows negligible potential to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs that are metabolised via other cytochrome P450 enzymes.In patients with pre-existing mild to severe hepatic impairment, single dose pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the clearance of terbinafine can be reduced by 50%. Therapeutic use of terbinafine in patients with chronic or active liver disease has not been studied in prospective clinical trials, and therefore can not be recommended. Terbinafine is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.Terbinafine Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, February 2011.Lamisil tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Lamisil tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease.  Prior to excretion, terbinafine is extensively metabolized by at least seven CYP isoenzymes with major contributions from CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor.Lamisil Prescribing Information, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, November 2011.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Varenicline	DB01273	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline.

Boceprevir	DB08873	Venlafaxine	DB00285	Coadministration has not been studied. Venlafaxine is metabolised by CYP2D6 (major) and CYP3A4 and CYP2C9/19. There may be an increase in venlafaxine concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A4. A clinically significant effect on boceprevir exposure is unlikely.	Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and venlafaxine may increase levels of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Therefore, caution is advised if a patient's therapy includes a CYP3A4 inhibitor and venlafaxine concomitantly. Bonilux XL Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Ltd, April 2009.Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and venlafaxine may increase levels of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Therefore, caution is advised if a patient's therapy includes a CYP3A4 inhibitor and venlafaxine concomitantly. In vitro studies indicate that venlafaxine is likely metabolized to a minor, less active metabolite, N-desmethylvenlafaxine, by CYP3A4. Because CYP3A4 is typically a minor pathway relative to CYP2D6 in the metabolism of venlafaxine, the potential for a clinically significant drug interaction between drugs that inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and venlafaxine is small.  Venlafaxine did not inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro.  This finding was confirmed in vivo by clinical drug interaction studies in which venlafaxine did not inhibit the metabolism of several CYP3A4 substrates, including alprazolam, diazepam, and terfenadine.Effexor Prescribing Information, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, January 2010.

Entecavir	DB00442	Aciclovir	DB00787	Coadministration has not been studied. Aciclovir is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine via active renal tubular secretion. Since entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney, coadministration with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either medicinal product. Apart from lamivudine, adefovir and tenofovir, the effects of coadministration of entecavir with medicinal products that are excreted renally or affect renal function have not been evaluated. Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions when entecavir is coadministered with such medicinal products.	(See Summary)

Entecavir	DB00442	Adefovir		A pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction when adefovir and entecavir were co-administered. 	No pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and lamivudine, adefovir or tenofovir were observed.Baraclude Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, September 2010. Coadministration of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in significant drug interactions.Baraclude US Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, October 2010. In a fixed-sequence crossover design in healthy adult subjects (n=26), subjects received 10 mg adefovir daily on days 1 to 4, 1 mg entecavir on days 5 to 14, and 1 mg entecavir plus 10 mg adefovir on days 15 to 24. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC, peak plasma concentration, and 24 hour post-dose plasma concentration of entecavir and adefovir were unchanged. Entecavir and adefovir were well tolerated when administered in combination. Therefore, the pharmacokinetic data generated in this study indicate that entecavir and adefovir can be coadministered without dose adjustment.Absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between entecavir and adefovir.  Bifano M, Yan Y-H, Smith R  et al. J Clin Pharmacol 2007; 47: 1327-1334.

Entecavir	DB00442	Alendronic acid	DB00630	Co-administration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. 	(See Summary)

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Abacavir	DB01048	No significant pharmacokinetic interactions observed.	Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant interactions between abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Ziagen Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, November 2009.Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase, 15 HIV-infected patients were enrolled in a crossover study evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir. Ziagen Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, December 2008.The pharmacokinetics and safety of single doses of abacavir (600 mg), zidovudine (300 mg) and lamivudine (150 mg) were evaluated when given alone or with either or both of the other drugs to 13 HIV-infected subjects. Coadministration of abacavir with lamivudine (with or without zidovudine) decreased lamivudine AUC by ~15%, decreased Cmax by ~ 35% and delayed Tmax by ~1 h. While these changes are statistically significant, they are not considered to be clinically significant. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir when given alone, or with zidovudine or lamivudine, or with both zidovudine and lamivudine. Single dose pharmacokinetics and safety of abacavir (1592U98), zidovudine, and lamivudine administered alone and in combination in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Wang LH, et al.

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Acetazolamide	DB00819	Coadministration has not been studied. Acetazolamide is predominantly excreted unchanged via active renal tubular secretion. In vitro studies have shown acetazolamide may competitively inhibit renal transporters hOAT1, hOAT3 and hOAT4. Thus, there is potential for competition with lamivudine for active renal transport mechanisms which may lead to increased levels of either drug. 	(See Summary)

Concomitant administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil and 100 mg lamivudine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either medicinal product.Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated following multiple dose administration of adefovir (10 mg once daily) in combination with lamivudine (100 mg once daily), in healthy volunteers (n=18). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir and lamivudine were unchanged.Hepsera US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, October 2009.

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Alendronic acid	DB00630	Co-administration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. 	(See Summary)

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Ampicillin	DB00415	This interaction has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion. Approximately 20 to 40% of an oral dose and 60 to 80% of a parenteral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.  As lamivudine is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. When administered orally, there is little potential for significant interaction.	(See Summary)

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Atazanavir	DB01072	No clinically significant interaction with atazanavir. No data with atazanavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/cobicistat. No need to adjust doses.	Lamivudine metabolism does not involve CYP3A, making interactions with medicinal products metabolised by this system (e.g. PIs) unlikely. Epivir Summary of Product Characteristics, ViiV Healthcare UK Ltd, October 2009.No significant effect on lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations was observed when atazanavir (400 mg once daily) was coadministered with lamivudine/zidovudine (150/300 mg twice daily). Based on these data and because ritonavir is not expected to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of NRTIs, the co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir with these medicinal products is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of the co-administered drugs. Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, July 2009.Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) was studied in 19 subjects. There were negligible increases in the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of lamivudine (4%, 3% and 12%, respectively). Cmax and AUC of zidovudine increased by 5% and there was a 31% and 18% reduction in the Cmin of zidovudine and zidovudine glucuronide, respectively.

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Capecitabine	DB01101	Coadministration has not been studied. Capecitabine is activated by sequential enzyme reactions to fluorouracil. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase plays a role in fluorouracil metabolism. Nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine may compete for or inhibit this metabolism pathway, leading to increased fluorouracil toxicity. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown and clinical monitoring is recommended. 	(See Summary)

(See Summary)
Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Cefotaxime	DB00493	Coadministration has not been studied. Most of a dose of cefotaxime is excreted in the urine - about 60% as unchanged drug and a further 24% as desacetyl-cefotaxime, an active metabolite. In vitro studies have shown that cefotaxime dose-dependently inhibits organic anion uptake mediated by human-OAT2. Probenecid, an inhibitor of renal tubular excretion, interferes with renal tubular transfer of cefotaxime delaying its excretion. As lamivudine is predominantly excreted by active renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition for renal elimination pathways, which may increase levels of either drug. 	(See Summary)

Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Peg-IFN alfa		Lamivudine has no pharmacokinetic interaction with alpha-interferon when the two medicinal products are concurrently administered. However, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing HIV therapy and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anaemia. 	Lamivudine has no pharmacokinetic interaction with alpha-interferon when the two medicinal products are concurrently administered. Zeffix Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, September 2010.Multiple doses of lamivudine and a single dose of interferon were coadministered to 19 healthy male subjects in a pharmacokinetics study. Results indicated a small (10%) reduction in lamivudine AUC, but no change in interferon pharmacokinetic parameters when the drugs were given in combination. All other pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, T1/2) were unchanged. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between lamivudine and interferon alfa in this study.Epivir-HBV US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, October 2007.  Results from pharmacokinetic substudies of pivotal phase III trials demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interaction of lamivudine on Pegasys in HBV patients or between Pegasys and ribavirin in HCV patients. Pegasys Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2010. Patients receiving PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a)/COPEGUS (ribavirin) and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a), COPEGUS (ribavirin) or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment- associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.Cirrhotic  chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients’ clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score ≥6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. Dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS, COPEGUS or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.Pegasys US Prescribing Information, Genentech Inc, June 2010.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin.

However, unless the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of lamivudine is necessary.Zeffix Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, September 2010.Lamivudine and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) were coadministered to 14 HIV-positive patients in a single-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study. Each patient received a single 300 mg dose of lamivudine and TMP 160 mg/SMX 800 mg once a day for 5 days with concomitant administration of lamivudine 300 mg with the fifth dose in a crossover design. Coadministration resulted in an increase of 44% ± 23% (mean ± SD) in lamivudine AUC, a decrease of 29% ± 13% in lamivudine oral clearance, and a decrease of 30% ± 36% in lamivudine renal clearance. The pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by coadministration with lamivudine. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.Epivir-HBV US Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, October 2007.

Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Atazanavir	DB01072	No clinically significant interactions were observed when atazanavir/ritonavir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were coadministered (ledipasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 98%, 113% and 136%; sofosbuvir Cmax decreased by 4% and AUC increased in by 8%; atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 7%, 33% and 75%; ritonavir Cmax decreased by 7% whereas AUC and Cmin increased by 5% and 56%). Coadministration with atazanavir and cobicistat has not been studied. Note, coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and regimens containing a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir and tenofovir may increase tenofovir concentrations. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions including frequent renal monitoring.	Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/400 mg once daily) increased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 7%, 33% and 75%.

The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been established. The combination should be used with caution with frequent renal monitoring, if other alternatives are not available. Atazanavir concentrations are also increased, with a risk for an increase in bilirubin levels/icterus. That risk is even higher if ribavirin is used as part of the HCV treatment. Simultaneous coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily), emtricitabine/tenofovir (200/300 mg once daily) and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/40 mg once daily) was studied.

(See Summary)
Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Lopinavir	DB01601	Coadministration has not been studied. Based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant effect on the concentrations of lopinavir, ritonavir, ledipasvir or sofosbuvir is unlikely. However, case reports suggest a possible interaction between lopinavir and ledipasvir with patients having drug-induced liver injury manifesting as significant bilirubin rise within two weeks of starting ledipasvir/sofosbuvir while on lopinavir-containing ART. Note, coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and regimens containing a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir and tenofovir may increase tenofovir concentrations. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions including frequent renal monitoring.	The interaction with lopinavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine and tenofovir has not been studied. When given with lopinavir/ritonavir used in conjunction with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is expected to increase the concentration of tenofovir, lopinavir, ritonavir and ledipasvir. No effect on emtricitabine, sofosbuvir or GS-331-007 is expected. The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been established. The combination should be used with caution with frequent renal monitoring, if other alternatives are not available.Harvoni Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, November 2014 Coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and regimens containing tenofovir and a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir may increase tenofovir concentrations. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in the setting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir has not been established. Consider alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in tenofovir exposures. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions.Harvoni US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences, October 2014.Case reports from three patients suggest a possible interaction between lopinavir and ledipasvir. All three patients were stable on lopinavir-containing regimens and had probably/highly probable drug-induced liver injury presenting as isolated bilirubin increases with peak elevations 2–14 times the upper normal limit within two weeks of initiating ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Acenocoumarol	DB01418	Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at steady-state did not affect the plasma exposures of the anticoagulant warfarin which is metabolised in a similar way. However, a case report describes a patient who required a significant increase in acenocoumarol weekly dose probably due to an interaction with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and/or dasabuvir. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and acenocoumarol can be coadministered but with close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) as dose modifications may be necessary in some patients.	A case was reported of a patient who required a significant increase in acenocoumarol weekly dose probably due to an interaction with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and/or dasabuvir. A causality assessment of the drug-drug interaction leading to a reduced INR was conducted according to the Naranjo algorithm. A score of 6 suggested that the adverse drug reaction was probable. Because of possible INR abnormalities during the concomitant use of acenocoumarol, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, clinicians should closely monitor INR values.Decreased INR after acenocoumarol, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir co-administration. de Lorenzo-Pinto A, Giménez-Manzorro Á, Rodríguez-González CG, et al.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Artemisinin		Coadministration has not been studied. Artemisinin induces CYP3A4 and there is the possibility of a decrease in exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir although it is difficult to judge the clinical relevance.  Monitor for therapeutic effect.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Artesunate	DB09274	Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydroartemisinin (the active metabolite of artesunate) induces CYP3A4 and there is the possibility of a decrease in exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir although it is difficult to judge the clinical relevance. Monitor for therapeutic effect.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as ascorbic acid is largely hydrolysed to salicylic acid followed by conjugation with either glycine or glucuronic acid.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Aspirin		Coadministration has not been studied but aspirin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Aspirin is metabolised by deacetylation and UGT2B7 conjugation.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Astemizole	DB00637	Coadministration is contraindicated in the European product label due to the potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Astemizole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase astemizole concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as astemizole, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Atazanavir	DB01072	Atazanavir should be taken without ritonavir or cobicistat with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir since ritonavir is included in the regimen. Cobicistat or additional ritonavir is not recommended with atazanavir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	Coadministration with atazanavir (300 mg once daily, given at the same time) decreased atazanavir Cmax and Cmin by 9% and 10%, but increased AUC by 1%. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 23%, 17% and 11%. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC increased by 46% and 94% and Cmin increased by 3.26-fold. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 17%, 18% and 21%, respectively. The increase in paritaprevir exposures may be due to inhibition of OATP1B1/B3 and CYP3A by atazanavir. Coadministration with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily administered 12 hour apart) increased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2%, 19% and 68%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 17% and 10% and there was no change in Cmin. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.19-, 3.16- and 11.95-fold, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 19%, 19% and 20%, respectively. The increase in paritaprevir exposures may be due to inhibition of OATP1B1/B3 and CYP3A by atazanavir and CYP3A by the additional dose of ritonavir. The recommended dose of atazanavir is 300 mg, without ritonavir and must be administered at the same time as ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir. Atazanavir should be taken without (additional) ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of Viekirax. The combination carries an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia (including ocular icterus), in particular when ribavirin is part of the hepatitis C regimen.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration with atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily in the evening) was studied in 11 subjects. Ombitasvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 17% and 10% and there was no change in Cmin. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.19-, 3.16- and 11.95-fold, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax increased by 60% and AUC and Cmin increased by 3.18- and 24.65-fold. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 19%, 19% and 20%, respectively. Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2%, 19% and 68%, respectively. When coadministered, atazanavir 300 mg (without ritonavir) should only be given in the morning.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Atenolol	DB00335	Coadministration has not been studied but atenolol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Atenolol is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Atomoxetine	DB00289	Coadministration has not been studied. Atomoxetine is a substrate of CYP2D6 but at 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Atomoxetine's active metabolite, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, is a substrate of UGT and, theoretically, its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in atomoxetine dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Atorvastatin	DB01076	Coadministration is contraindicated in the European product label. Coadministration has not been studied. Atorvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and OATP1B1 by paritaprevir.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of atorvastatin due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and OATP1B. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as atorvastatin, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Atovaquone	DB01117	Atovaquone exposure may decrease when co-administered with ritonavir. The co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with atovaquone led to a decrease in atovaquone AUC of 74%. Monitor the subjects. An increase in atovaquone dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Atropine	DB00572	Coadministration has not been studied. Atropine metabolism has not been well described but is thought to be by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites and up to 50% is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely; however, by possibly delaying gastric emptying, atropine may alter the absorption of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir but the clinical significance of this is unknown.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Azathioprine	DB00993	Coadministration has not been studied but azathioprine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. There is no overlap of metabolic pathways, so no interaction is expected. However note that azathioprine has an interaction with ribavirin such that if ribavirin is part of the regimen it is important to refer to the summary information given for ribavirin and azathioprine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Azilsartan		Azilsartan can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Azilsartan is a substrate of CYP2C9 but there was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate. Therefore, no interaction is expected with azilsartan.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Azithromycin	DB00207	Coadministration has not been studied. Azithromycin may theoretically interact with the paritaprevir component of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir via MRP2 but no dose alteration is required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Aztreonam	DB00355	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug interaction is unlikely. Aztreonam is only minimally metabolised and is eliminated mainly unchanged in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Baclofen	DB00181	Coadministration has not been studied but baclofen can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Baclofen is mainly excreted in the urine or deaminated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Basilixumab		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Basiliximab is an immunoglobulin and no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. Extensive studies have been carried out with concomitant medication showing no adverse effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Beclometasone		Coadministration has not been studied but beclometasone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Beclometasone is metabolised by hydrolysis to beclometasone 17-monopropionate in vivo although it is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. No evidence of adrenal suppression was observed with either darunavir/ritonavir or ritonavir and beclometasone.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Benazepril	DB00542	Coadministration has not been studied. Benazepril is a substrate of UGTs (the specific UGTs have not been well described) and its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. The exposure of raltegravir (a UGT substrate) was increased by up to 2-fold with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir; a similar interaction is possible with other UGT substrates. In the absence of further data, monitor cardiac parameters and for increased side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bendroflumethiazide	DB00436	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Bendroflumethiazide is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism, although the exact pathway is not known. It is unlikely that CYP enzymes are involved in this process and no transporter interactions have been described.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Benztropine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Benztropine is primarily metabolised by CYP2D6, with minor involvement from CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Benzylpenicillin	DB01053	Coadministration has not been studied but benzylpenicillin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Benzylpenicillin is mainly excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bepridil	DB01244	Do not coadminister unless unavoidable. Bepridil is a substrate of CYP3A4 and exposure may markedly increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in the potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. If coadministration is warranted, use with caution and therapeutic concentration monitoring (if available) is recommended.	Coadministration may increase concentrations of this antiarrhythmic. Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring (if available) is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Betamethasone	DB00443	Coadministration has not been studied. Betamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. A significant betamethasone dose reduction is recommended. Monitor the subject closely for corticosteroid side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bezafibrate	DB01393	Coadministration has not been studied. Bezafibrate is metabolised by hydroxylation, glucuronidation and renal elimination (~50%). Due to involvement of multiple metabolic pathways and renal elimination, a clinically significant interaction is not expected with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir Note, the European SPC for bezafibrate contraindicates its use in significant hepatic disease.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bilastine	DB11591	Coadministration has not been studied but bilastine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Bilastine is not significantly metabolized and is mainly excreted in the urine. In-vitro studies show that bilastine is a substrate of P-gp, but as there is no significant interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and digoxin (a model P-gp substrate), no potential interaction due to P-gp involvement is expected with bilastine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bisacodyl	DB09020	Coadministration has not been studied. Bisacodyl increases colonic mass movements and may affect absorption of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. The potential interaction can be resolved by giving bisacodyl at least 4 hours after ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bisoprolol	DB00612	Coadministration has not been studied. Bisoprolol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in bisoprolol dose may be needed. Note, the European product label for bisoprolol recommends a maximum of 10 mg in severe hepatic impairment; the US Prescribing Information recommends an initial 2.5 mg in hepatic impairment with caution in further dose titration.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Boceprevir	DB08873	Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is a complete regimen. There are no data to support the coadministration with other DAAs.	The safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been established in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin. Co-administration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with other directly acting antivirals has not been studied and therefore cannot be recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bortezomib	DB00188	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase bortezomib concentrations due to inhibition of CYP34 by ritonavir. Coadministration with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased bortezomib AUC by 35%. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bosentan	DB00559	Avoid use of bosentan with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Bosentan is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and OATPs 1B1 and 1B3. Bosentan exposure increased 30-fold when administered with cyclosporine, an OATP1B1 inhibitor. Paritaprevir is also an OATP1B1 inhibitor and a similar interaction is expected with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Bosentan exposure increased 5-fold and metabolite levels were undetectable due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and liver problems. Thus, in addition to the OATP1B interaction potential, there is also CYP3A4 interaction potential. Use an alternative to bosentan.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Brivudine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as brivudine is an analog of thymidine and is incorporated into viral DNA. The metabolism of brivudine is poorly described but to date there is no evidence of CYP or P-gp involvement.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bromazepam	DB01558	Coadministration has not been studied but bromazepam can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Bromazepam is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromazepam were not affected by itraconazole, suggesting that CYP3A4 is not involved in the metabolism of bromazepam to a major extent. Thus, no interaction is expected with ritonavir. There is also no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and warfarin, a CYP2C9/CYP1A2 substrate. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bromocriptine	DB01200	Coadministration has not been studied. Bromocritpine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in bromocriptine dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bromperidol		Coadministration has not been studied. Bromperidol is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Monitor for signs and symptoms of increased concentrations.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Budesonide	DB01222	Concomitant administration of ritonavir and glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with inhaled or intranasally administered budesonide. Use beclometasone as an alternative. Budesonide is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing a decrease in plasma cortisol leading to Cushing's syndrome. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bumetanide	DB00887	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as bumetanide is mainly excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bupivacaine	DB00297	Coadministration has not been studied. Bupivacaine is metabolised by UGT1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, and amide hydrolysis. Due to the involvement of UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 an increase in bupivacaine concentrations may occur. Monitor clinically and consider dose reduction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Buprenorphine	DB00921	Coadministration with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) increased buprenorphine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.18-, 2.07- and 3.12-fold, respectively; values for norbuprenorphine increased by 2.07-, 1.84- and 2.10-fold, respectively. There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir based on cross-study comparison. No a priori dose modification is required but patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects.	Coadministration with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) increased buprenorphine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.18-, 2.07- and 3.12-fold, respectively; values for norbuprenorphine increased by 2.07-, 1.84- and 2.10-fold, respectively. Naloxone Cmax and AUC increased by 18% and 28%. (Dose normalised parameters reported for buprenorphine and naloxone.) The increases were due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and UGT inhibition by paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir. There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir based on cross-study comparison. No dose adjustment is necessary.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Coadministration with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) was studied in 10 subjects. Cmax, AUC and Cmin of buprenorphine increased by 2.18-, 2.07- and 3.12-fold, respectively; values for norbuprenorphine increased by 2.07-, 1.84- and 2.10-fold, respectively. Naloxone Cmax and AUC increased by 18% and 28%. No dose adjustment of buprenorphine/naloxone is required upon co-administration. Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Bupropion	DB01156	Coadministration has not been studied. No interaction was observed between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and methadone (CYP2B6 substrate). Hence, it is not expected to interact with other CYP2B6 substrates. Short-term ritonavir (200 mg; 4 doses over 2 days) dosing has only minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion while long term administration of low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) doses has shown only ≤22% decrease in bupropion exposures. However, monitor the subjects and adjust bupropion dose if clinically indicated. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Buspirone	DB00490	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of buspirone due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Using the lowest dose possible of buspirone is recommended, starting at 2.5mg. Monitor for increased side effects such as impaired psychomotor performance, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness and miosis and decrease dose if symptomatic. Use with caution in cirrhosis.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Calcitonin		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Calcitonin is metabolised primarily via proteolysis in the kidney.and to date no clinically significant interactions have been published that would be of concern.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Calcium resonium		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as calcium resonium is not absorbed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Canagliflozin	DB08907	Coadministration has not been studied. Canagliflozin is a substrate of UGTs and P-gp and its exposure may increase due to inhibition of UGTs by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. There was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and digoxin, a model P-gp substrate and any effect on canaglifoxin due to inhibition of P-gp is not considered likely. Monitor blood glucose.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Candesartan	DB00796	Coadministration has not been studied. Candesartan is mainly excreted in urine and is a substrate of OATP1B1. Candesartan exposure may increase due to OATP1B1 inhibition by the paritaprevir and ritonavir components of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Consider dose reduction and monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Note, use of candesartan in severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated in the European SPC; the US Prescribing Information recommends caution in moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cannabis		Coadministration has not been studied. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis) is metabolised mainly by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir may increase concentrations of THC by ritonavir inhibition of CYP3A4. The patient should be made aware of potential increased side effects. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Capecitabine	DB01101	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Capecitabine is a substrate of CYP2C9. There was no interaction between and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir, so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Capreomycin	DB00314	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as capreomycin is mainly excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Captopril	DB01197	Coadministration has not been studied but captopril can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Captopril is metabolised by sulfation and approximately 40-50% is excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Carbamazepine	DB00564	Coadministration is contraindicated. Carbamazepine is a substrate and inducer of CYPs 3A4, 2C8 and 1A2. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir exposures show significant decreases when administered with carbamazepine which may lead to virologic failure.	Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers, such as carbamazepine, is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered. Coadministration with carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily) increased carbamazepine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 10%, 17% and 35%, respectively, with the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide decreasing by 16%, 25% and 43%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax and AUC both decreased by 31%. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 66% and 70%. Dasabuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 55% and 70%.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Coadministration is contraindicated. Coadministration with carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Ombitasvir Cmax and AUC both decreased by 31%. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 66% and 70%. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC decreased by 83% and 87%. Dasabuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 55% and 70%.

The decrease in ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir exposures may lead to a potential loss of therapeutic activity of Viekira Pak®.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Carbidopa	DB00190	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carbidopa is partly metabolized and partly eliminated unchanged (30% of the total urinary excretion).	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Carbimazole	DB00389	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carbimazole is a pro-drug which undergoes rapid and virtually complete metabolism to the active metabolite, thiamazole (methimazole). There is little evidence of marked interactions with this drug.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Carboplatin	DB00958	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carboplatin is excreted primarily by renal glomerular filtration. In vitro studies have shown that carboplatin does not significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Carisoprodol	DB00395	Coadministration has not been studied. Carisoprodol is a substrate of CYP2C19 and its exposure may decrease due to CYP2C19 induction by ritonavir. Exposure of omeprazole, a model CYP2C19 substrate, decreased by ~50% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir, but exposures of each component of the DAA regimen were not affected. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with other CYP2C19 substrates. If coadministered, a higher dose of carisoprodol can be considered, if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Carvedilol	DB01136	Coadministration has not been studied. Carvedilol undergoes glucuronidation via UGTs 1A1, 2B4 and 2B7 and additionally metabolism via CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYPs 2C9 and 1A2. The net effect on carvedilol concentrations is difficult to predict. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir could potentially increase carvedilol concentrations. Monitor clinical effect. Note, the US Prescribing Information contraindicates carvedilol in patients with severe liver impairment and the European SPC contraindicates it in patients with hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Caspofungin	DB00520	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as caspofungin undergoes spontaneous chemical degradation and non-CYP medicated metabolism. Note, no dose adjustment is required in patients with normal hepatic function but a dose reduction of caspofungin daily dose to 35 mg is recommended for adults with moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in adults with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Celecoxib	DB00482	Coadministration has not been studied but celecoxib can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Celecoxib is a substrate of CYP2C9. There was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate so no interaction is expected with celecoxib. Note, use in patients with severe liver impairment is contraindicated in the European SPC and not recommended in the US Prescribing Information. In patients with moderate liver impairment (serum albumin 25-35 g/L, Child-Pugh Class B), celecoxib treatment should be started at half the recommended dose.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Celiprolol	DB04846	Coadministration has not been studied but celiprolol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Celiprolol is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and faeces.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cetirizine	DB00341	Coadministration has not been studied but cetirizine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Cetirizine is metabolised only to a limited extent and is eliminated unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Cetirizine is also transported by P-gp but as there is no significant interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and digoxin (a model P-gp substrate), no potential interaction due to P-gp involvement is expected with cetirizine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chlorambucil	DB00291	Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is considered unlikely. Very little has been described about chlorambucil metabolism in humans but CYP450 enzymes are not involved.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chloramphenicol	DB00446	Coadministration has not been studied. Chloramphenicol eye drops can be used for short term treatment. Chloramphenicol is an inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and is mainly excreted in urine. Inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of some co-administered drugs and could theoretically interact with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Avoid unless benefit outweighs the risk.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chloroquine	DB00608	Coadministration has not been studied. Following administration, chloroquine is rapidly metabolised by CYPs 2C8, 3A and 2D6 to desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine which have activity similar to chloroquine. Chloroquine is also renally eliminated. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir may decrease exposure to the active metabolites, but this may not affect overall activity. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended for chloroquine. Note, the European SPC and US Prescribing Information for chloroquine both recommend caution in impaired hepatic function.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chlorothiazide	DB00880	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Chlorothiazide is not metabolised and is eliminated rapidly by renal excretion.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chlorphenamine	DB01114	Coadministration has not been studied. Chlorphenamine is a substrate of CYP2D6 with possible involvement of CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. While no a priori dose adjustment is required monitor for increased side-effects while co-administering chlorphenamine with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chlorpromazine	DB00477	Coadministration has not been studied. Chlorpromazine is a substrate of CYPs 2D6 (major), 1A2 and 3A4 in vitro. Chlorpromazine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 and possibly CYP2D6 inhibition by ritonavir. No a priori dose modification is needed but monitor the subjects and dose decrease if required. Note, the European SPC for chlorpromazine advises that its use should be avoided in patients with hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Chlortalidone		Coadministration has not been studied but chlortalidone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Chlortalidone is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ciclesonide	DB01410	Ciclesonide can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide, the active metabolite of ciclesonide. Concentrations of the parent ciclesonide were not significantly altered. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by lungs and hence interaction with ketoconazole would not require any dosage/therapy adjustments due to the low potential of ciclesonide to cause systemic effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ciclosporin		Ciclosporin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Ciclosporin AUC and Ctrough increases by 5.8-fold and 15.8-fold respectively when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Give one-fifth of the total daily dose of ciclosporin once daily when coadministered. Monitor ciclosporin levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed.	Coadministration increased ciclosporin Cmax by 1%, but increased AUC and Cmin by 5.82- and 15.8-fold (ciclosporin 100 mg dosed alone, 30 mg coadministered; dose normalized ciclosporin ratios are shown). Ombitasvir Cmax decreased by 1% but AUC and Cmin increased 8% and 15%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 44%, 72% and 85%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 34%, 30% and 24%, respectively. The effect on ciclosporin is due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and the increase in paritaprevir exposures may be due to OATP/BCRP/P-gp inhibition by ciclosporin. When starting co-administration, give one fifth of the total daily dose of ciclosporin once daily. Monitor ciclosporin levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed. Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration with cyclosporine (30 mg single dose) was studied in 10 subjects and compared to values obtained with cyclosporine (100 mg) alone. Ombitasvir Cmax decreased by 1% but AUC and Cmin increased 8% and 15%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 44%, 72% and 85%. Ritonavir Cmax decreased by 10%, but AUC and Cmin increased by 11% and 49%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 34%, 30% and 24%, respectively. When compared to 100 mg alone, cyclosporine Cmax increased by 1%, but AUC and Cmin increased by 5.82- and 15.80-fold. When initiating therapy with Viekira Pak®, reduce cyclosporine dose to 1/5th of the patient’s current cyclosporine dose. Measure cyclosporine blood concentrations to determine subsequent dose modifications.  Upon completion of Viekira Pak® therapy, the appropriate time to resume pre-therapy dose of cyclosporine should be guided by assessment of cyclosporine blood concentrations. Frequent assessment of renal function and cyclosporine-related side effects is recommended.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cidofovir	DB00369	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as cidofovir is mainly excreted in the urine via glomerular filtration and active secretion by OAT1/3.	(See Summary)

Cilazapril is metabolised by esterases to the active cilazaprilat which is excreted unchanged in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cilostazol	DB01166	Coadministration has not been studied. Cilostazol is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2. Coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir may increase concentrations of cilostazol leading to increased side effects. The product label for cilostazol suggests a dose reduction to 50 mg twice daily when given with CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19 inhibitors.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cimetidine	DB00501	Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Cimetidine is an inhibitor of CYP isozymes but less potent than ritonavir. No effect of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir on cimetidine is expected since cimetidine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ciprofloxacin	DB00537	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ciprofloxacin is primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion via OAT3. It is also metabolized and partially cleared through the bile and intestine.	Coadministration did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 substrate, duloxetine. Other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are not expected to require dose adjustments.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cisapride	DB00604	Coadministration is contraindicated in the European product label. Cisapride is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase cisapride concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as cisapride, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cisatracurium		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clevidipine	DB04920	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Clevidipine is rapidly metabolised by hydrolysis of the ester linkage and does not undergo CYP metabolism.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clindamycin	DB01190	Coadministration has not been studied. Clindamycin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subject and use caution. A decrease in clindamycin dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clobazam	DB00349	Coadministration has not been studied. Clobazam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C19 but its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Consider starting patient on current dose with close clinical monitoring for side effects associated with clobazam and decrease dose if necessary.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clobetasol (topical)		Coadministration has not been studied but topical clobetasol can be used with caution. Clobetasol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clobetasone (topical)	DB13158	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Following topical application to most areas of normal skin, only minimal amounts of the drug reach the dermis and subsequently the systemic circulation. Although clobetasone is a substrate of CYP3A4, a clinically significant effect is unlikely due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clomifene	DB00882	Coadministration has not been studied. Studies suggest that clomifene is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and UGTs and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clomipramine	DB01242	Coadministration has not been studied. Clomipramine is a substrate of CYPs 2C19, 3A4 and 1A2. Clomipramine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. Use the lowest possible dose of clomipramine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clonazepam	DB01068	Coadministration has not been studied. Clonazepam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir, resulting in the possibility of prolonged and/or increased pharmacologic effects of the benzodiazepine, including sedation and respiratory depression. Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended, a decrease in dose of clonazepam may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clonidine	DB00575	Coadministration has not been studied. Clonidine is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. At 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not inhibit CYP2D6, but theoretically, clonidine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. Use the lowest possible dose of clonidine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Clopidogrel	DB00758	Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel. Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. In addition, clinical studies have show a major metabolite of clopidogrel to be an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and therefore could increase dasabuvir concentrations. An alternative to clopidogrel should be considered. Note, the European SPC for clopidogrel contraindicates it use in severe hepatic impairment but the US Prescribing Information states no dose alteration.	A 64-year-old man presented with increasing shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain radiating to his left shoulder and neck. His home medications included darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, isoniazid, pyridoxine, clopidogrel, aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, valsartan, sertraline, tamsulosin and esomeprazole. Potential drug-drug interactions between isoniazid and clopidogrel, and ritonavir and clopidogrel were identified that could interfere with clopidogrel activation. Based on this, platelet function testing was completed and impaired clopidogrel response was seen on two platelet function tests. There was no genetic cause (i.e., CYP2C19 genotype) for the impaired clopidogrel response.A patient with HIV and tuberculosis with diminished clopidogrel response. Metzger NL, Momary KN.

Coadministration may increase concentrations of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and dasabuvir due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by cobicistat.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration is expected to increase concentrations of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and dasabuvir due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by cobicistat.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cocaine	DB00907	Coadministration has not been studied. Cocaine is metabolised by several pathways with metabolism to norcocaine by CYP3A4 being less than 10% of the overall metabolic clearance. Although concentrations could increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 it is difficult to judge the significance. Ensure the patient is aware of signs/symptoms of cocaine toxicity.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Codeine	DB00318	Coadministration has not been studied. Codeine is a substrate of CYP2D6 (major) and CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. While no a priori dose adjustment is required for codeine, monitor for increased side-effects while co-administering codeine with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Decrease codeine dose, if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Colchicine	DB01394	Coadministration has not been studied. Colchicine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Colchicine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Fatal colchicine toxicity has been reported with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in colchicine dose may be needed. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with ritonavir. Refer to the ritonavir product label.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of colchicine due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. A reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function. In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, use of colchicine is contraindicated.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cyclobenzaprine	DB00924	Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclobenzaprine undergoes a complex metabolic process involving glucuronidation and several CYP enzymes including CYPs 3A4 and 1A2. Coadministration may increase cyclobenzaprine concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, though the clinical significance of this is unknown. Monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Cytisine	DB09028	Coadministration has not been studied and the pharmacokinetics of cytisine are poorly described. There are no reports of drug interactions or CYP involvement.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dabigatran		Coadministration has not been studied. Dabigatran exposure may theoretically increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Dabigatran is metabolised by hydrolysis and is a substrate of UGT and P-gp. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir increased exposure of raltegravir (a UGT substrate) by up to 2-fold and a similar interaction is possible with other UGT substrates. Use with caution. Monitor the subjects; a reduction in dabigatran dose may be needed or start with the lowest possible dose. 	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentration of dabigatran due to inhibition of intestinal P-gp by paritaprevir and ritonavir. Use with caution.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.

The safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been  established in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin.  Co-administration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with  other directly acting antivirals has not been studied and therefore  cannot be recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dalteparin	DB06779	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as dalteparin is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Danaparoid		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Danaparoid is renally excreted and no hepatic involvement was shown in animal studies. Note, caution is required if using in patients with renal impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dantron	DB04816	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Dantron is absorbed from the small intestine and acts at the large intestine. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dapagliflozin	DB06292	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Dapagliflozin is metabolised by UGT1A9 which is not known to be affected by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dapsone	DB00250	Coadministration has not been studied. Metabolism is largely via N-acetylation and multiple CYP enzymes have been described. An interaction cannot be excluded but is unlikely. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Darbepoetin		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Darbepoetin is not hepatically metabolized and to date no clinically significant interactions have been published that would be of concern.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Darunavir	DB01264	Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir decreased darunavir Ctrough by ~50%, although Cmax and AUC did not show a clinically significant change. Although coadministration of darunavir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is not recommended in the US Prescribing Information, the European SPC states that coadministration is not recommended in patients with extensive HIV PI resistance. The European SPC advises that darunavir (dosed at 800 mg once daily and administered at the same time as ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir) can be used in the absence of extensive HIV PI resistance and should be taken without additional ritonavir, since ritonavir 100 mg once daily is provided as part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination. Exercise caution with use dependent on knowledge of the patient. Darunavir/cobicistat should not be coadministered as ritonavir is part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination.	Coadministration with darunavir (800 mg once daily given at the same time) decreased darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 8%, 24% and 48%. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 14%, 14% and 13%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 54%, 29% and 30%, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax increased by 10%, but AUC and Cmin decreased by 6% and 10%. Coadministration with darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) decreased darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 13%, 20% and 43%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 24%, 27% and 27%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 30%, 41% and 17%, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 16%, 27% and 46%, respectively. Coadministration with darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily administered 12 hours apart) decreased darunavir Cmax and Cmin by 21% and 46%, but increased AUC by 34%. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin all decreased by 13%. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 30% and 19%, but Cmin increased by 59%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 25%, 28% and 35%. The recommended dose of darunavir is 800 mg once daily, without ritonavir, when administered at the same time as ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir (ritonavir dose in Viekirax will provide darunavir pharmacokinetic enhancement). This regimen can be used in the absence of extensive PI resistance (i.e. lack of darunavir associated RAMs). Darunavir combined with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir is not recommended in patients with extensive PI resistance.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, July 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, July 2015. Coadministration with darunavir (800 mg once daily) was studied in 9 subjects and compared to values obtained with darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) alone. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 14%, 14% and 13%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 54%, 29% and 30%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC decreased by 16% and 15%, but Cmin increased by 7%. Dasabuvir Cmax increased by 10%, but AUC and Cmin decreased by 6% and 10%. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 8%, 24% and 48%. Coadministration with darunavir (600 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily in the evening) was studied in 7 subjects and compared to values obtained with darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) alone. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 24%, 27% and 27%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 30%, 41% and 17%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC increased by 61% and 28%, but Cmin decreased by 12%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 16%, 27% and 46%, respectively. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 13%, 20% and 43%, respectively. Coadministration with darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) was studied in 12 subjects and compared to values obtained with darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) alone. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin all decreased by 13%. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 30% and 19%, but Cmin increased by 59%. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC increased by 19% and 70%, with Cmin increasing by 14.15-fold. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 25%, 28% and 35%. Darunavir Cmax and Cmin decreased by 21% and 46%, but AUC increased by 34%. Co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir is not recommended.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dasatinib	DB01254	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of both dasatinib and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Dasatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4. There could be a marked increase in dasatinib exposure and it is also possible that ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir exposure may be increased. Coadministration is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Use with caution.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Delavirdine	DB00705	Coadministration has not been studied. Delavirdine is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. Appropriate doses of this combination, with respect to safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics, have not been established.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Desipramine	DB01151	Coadministration has not been studied but desipramine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no a priori dose alteration is required. Desipramine is a substrate of CYP2D6, and did not show interaction with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	Coadministration did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 substrate, duloxetine. Other CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine) are not expected to require dose adjustments.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Desloratidine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. The metabolism of desloratidine is poorly characterised and no clinically relevant interaction have been observed with other inhibitors of CYP enzymes.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Desmopressin	DB00035	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as desmopressin undergoes no significant metabolism.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Desogestrel	DB00304	Coadministration has not been studied. Desogestrel is a prodrug that requires activation to etonogestrel. Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration may increase the conversion to the active metabolite etonogestrel due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Although no dose adjustment is necessary for norethindrone (a progestogen) when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir in the absence of an estrogen, it is unclear if this will apply to other orally administered progestogen only contraceptives.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Desvenlafaxine	DB06700	Coadministration has not been studied. Desvenlafaxine is a substrate of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-gp. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4/P-gp, increased exposure of venlafaxine and its metabolite by 20-141%. A similar magnitude of increase may be seen due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in dose may be needed. Note, a maximum dose of 50 mg is recommended in moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dexamethasone	DB01234	Coadministration has not been studied. Dexamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Dexamethasone exposure (after IV and oral administration) increased by 3.3- to 3.7-fold when administered with itraconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. A similar magnitude of increase may be seen with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects for side effects due to adrenal suppression. A decrease in dexamethasone dose is recommended. Dexamethasone is also known as a CYP3A4 inducer and it may potentially decrease concentrations and therefore efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dextromethorphan	DB00514	Coadministration has not been studied but dextromethorphan can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alternation is required. Dextromethorphan is a substrate of CYP2D6 but ritonavir at the 100 mg dose does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	Coadministration did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 substrate, duloxetine. Other CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. dextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dextropropoxyphene	DB00647	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from most European and North American countries due to the risk of arrhythmias and fatalities. As it is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4, coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir could markedly increase the exposure of dextropropoxyphene.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Diamorphine		Coadministration has not been studied. Diamorphine is metabolised by hydrolysis to its metabolite morphine. Morphine is metabolized by UGT2B7, UGT1A3 with a minor contribution from CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. No a priori dose adjustment is required for diamorphine, however, monitor for side effects and decrease dose, if needed. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Diazepam	DB00829	Coadministration of diazepam (2 mg single dose) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir increased diazepam Cmax by 18%, but decreased AUC by 22%. Nordiazepam Cmax increased by 10%, but AUC decreased by 40%. There was no clinically significant effect on exposures of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir or dasabuvir. No a priori dose modification is recommended, but monitor the patient and adjust the dose if clinically indicated. 	Coadministration of diazepam (2 mg single dose) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir was studied in 15 subjects. Diazepam Cmax increased by 18%, but AUC decreased by 22%; nordiazepam Cmax increased by 10%, but AUC decreased by 40%. There was no clinically significant effect on exposures of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir or dasabuvir.Drug-drug interactions of commonly used medications with direct acting antiviral HCV combination therapy of paritaprevir/r, ombitasvir and dasabuvir.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Diclofenac	DB00586	Coadministration has not been studied. Diclofenac is a substrate of CYP2C9, CYP3A4, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. With multiple pathways diclofenac exposure is not expected to increase with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. There was no interaction between and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir, so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Didanosine	DB00900	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Didanosine is phosphorylated to its active triphosphate form and is not a substrate of any CYP isoenzyme. It is renally excreted.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dienogest	DB09123	Coadministration has not been studied. Dienogest is metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration may increase dienogest concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Note, coadministration is CONTRAINDICATED when given as a combined oral contraceptive with ethinylestradiol due to an increase in ALT.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Diflunisal	DB00861	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as diflunisal is an aldoketoreductase inhibitor and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is not known to affect this pathway.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Digoxin	DB00390	Coadministration with digoxin (0.5 mg single dose) increased digoxin Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 15%, 16% and 1% due to inhibition of P-gp by paritaprevir. There were no clinically significant changes in exposures of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir or dasabuvir. No a priori dose adjustment of digoxin is required, but appropriate monitoring of serum digoxin levels is recommended.	Coadministration with digoxin (0.5 mg single dose) increased digoxin Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 15%, 16% and 1% due to inhibition of P-gp by paritaprevir. Ombitasvir Cmax increased by 3%, there was no change in AUC and Cmin decreased by 1%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 8%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 1%, 3% and 1%, respectively. While no dose adjustment is necessary for digoxin, appropriate monitoring of serum digoxin levels is recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.No dose adjustments are recommended when ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are co-administered with digoxin.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dihydroartemisinin		Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydroartemisinin (the active metabolite of artesunate) induces CYP3A4 and there is the possibility of a decrease in exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir although it is difficult to judge the clinical relevance. Monitor for therapeutic effect.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dihydrocodeine	DB01551	Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydrocodeine is a substrate of CYP2D6, UGT2B7 and CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. While no a priori dose adjustment is required for dihydrocodeine, monitor for increased side-effects with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Decrease dihydrocodeine dose if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dihydroergotamine	DB00320	Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been  studied but is expected to increase concentrations of ergot derivatives  due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are  highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma  levels are associated with serious events, such as ergot derivatives,  must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration is contraindicated. Acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and tissue ischemia has been associated with co-administration of ritonavir and dihydroergotamine.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Diltiazem	DB00343	Coadministration has not been studied. Diltiazem is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Concentrations of paritaprevir may increase, but the efffect on dasabuvir is unclear (no change or concentrations may increase). Use with caution due to the expected increase in paritaprevir exposures. Monitor the subjects. Start with the lowest possible dose. Clinical monitoring of calcium channel blockers is recommended when co-administered.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of diltiazem and paritaprevir due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp, and may increase (or have no effect on) concentrations of dasabuvir. Caution is advised due to the expected increase in paritaprevir exposures. Dose decrease and clinical monitoring of calcium channel blockers is recommended when co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Diphenhydramine	DB01075	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Diphenhydramine is a substrate of CYP2D6. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Note, diphenhydramine should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dipyridamole	DB00975	Coadministration has not been studied. Dipyridamole is glucuronidated but the UGTs involved have not been well described. Dipyridamole exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir but the magnitude of the interaction is difficult to predict. Monitor for increased side effects and toxicities of dipyridamole but no dose change at onset should be required. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Disopyramide	DB00280	Coadministration has not been studied. Disopyramide is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing cardiotoxicity. Therapeutic concentration monitoring should be done for disopyramide. A decrease in disopyramide dose may be needed.	Coadministration may increase concentrations of this antiarrhythmic. Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring (if available) is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Disulfiram	DB00822	Coadministration has not been studied but disulfiram can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Disulfiram is an inhibitor of ALDH.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dofetilide	DB00204	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended due to the increased risk of QT prolongation. Although dofetilide is only metabolised to a small extent by CYP3A4, use with concominant CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir may increase dofetilide concentrations, increasing the risk of QT prolongation. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dolutegravir	DB08930	Coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) was studied in 12 HIV/HCV-negative subjects and had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, dasabuvir or dolutegravir. No dose adjustment is required for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir or dolutegravir during coadministration.	Coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and dolutegravir (50 mg once daily) was studied in 12 HIV/HCV-negative subjects. During coadministration dolutegravir exposures were 22-38% higher, exposure of ombitasvir and dasabuvir were up to 18% lower, and paritaprevir and ritonavir Ctrough both decreased by 34%. No dose adjustment is recommended for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir or dolutegravir during coadministration.Drug-drug interactions of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r plus dasabuvir with dolutegravir or abacavir plus lamivudine.Khatn A, Trinh R, Zhao W, et al. 16th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV and Hepatitis Therapy, Washington DC, May 2015, Abstract 57.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Domperidone	DB01184	Coadministration has not been studied and is contraindicated with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir. Domperidone is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir could potentially increase domperidone exposure and increase the risk of cardiac adverse effects (QT interval prolongation).	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dorzolamide	DB00869	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as dorzolamide undergoes minimal metabolism and is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Doxazosin	DB00590	Coadministration has not been studied. Doxazosin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. Start with the lowest possible dose of doxazosin. Note, the European SPC does not recommend doxazosin in severe hepatic impairment; the US Prescribing Information has a caution for use in hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Doxepin	DB01142	Coadministration has not been studied but doxepin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Doxepin is metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at steady-state did not affect the plasma exposures of the anticoagulant warfarin which is metabolised by CYP2C9. Note, the European and US product labels for doxepin advise caution and monitoring in patients with hepatic impairment as a dosage reduction may be required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Doxorubicin	DB00997	Coadministration has not been studied. Doxorubicin is a substrate of P-gp and MRP1 and may theoretically interact with the ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir components of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir causing cytotoxicity. Monitor subjects for an appropriate and expected response to doxorubicin or ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Doxycycline	DB00254	Coadministration has not been studied but doxycycline can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Doxycycline is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dronedarone	DB04855	Coadministration has not been studied. Dronedarone is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ritonavir, is contraindicated in its product labels due to increased risk of QT prolongation.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Droperidol	DB00450	Coadministration has not been studied but droperidol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alternation is required. However, droperidol has a QT risk and concentrations may alter due to induction of CYP1A2 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. If coadministration is deemed necessary, caution is warranted and clinical monitoring for increased side effects should be performed including ECG monitoring.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Drospirenone	DB01395	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance an interaction is unlikely. Drospirenone is metabolised mainly without involvement of CYP enzymes with little known involvement of transporters. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Dulaglutide	DB09045	Coadministration has not been studied. Dulaglutide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. It is advisable to separate administration if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Duloxetine	DB00476	Duloxetine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Duloxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. There was no interaction between duloxetine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Coadministration with duloxetine (60 mg single dose) decreased duloxetine Cmax and AUC by 21% and 25%. Ombitasvir Cmax decreased by 2%, there was no change in AUC and Cmin increased by 1%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 21%, 17% and 23%, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 6%, 8% and 12%, respectively. Note, duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment as concentrations may increase due to decreased clearance of duloxetine.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Echinacea		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and potent 3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Fludarabine	DB01073	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed (non-CYP mediated) to 2F-ara-A, the principal metabolite, which is then eliminated renally.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Fludrocortisone	DB00687	Coadministration has not been studied. Concomitant administration of ritonavir and corticosteroids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Fludrocortisone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Use alternative treatments.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Fluindione		Coadministration has not been studied. Fluinidone is metabolised by CYP2C9 (major) and CYP1A2 (minor). Clinical studies showed no interaction between and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir, so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement. Any decrease in concentrations of fluindione due to induction of CYP1A2 by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is unlikely to be of clinical significance as this is a minor route of metabolism. However, case reports have described alterations in INR for patients receiving ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with warfarin or acenocoumarol, so close monitoring of INR is recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Flunisolide	DB00180	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase flunisolide concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. An alternative to flunisolide should be used if available.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Fluticasone		Concomitant administration of ritonavir and glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Fluticasone is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of fluticasone may markedly increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing a decrease in plasma cortisol leading to Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with fluticasone. Use beclomethasone as an alternative.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of fluticasone due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Caution should be used with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoids metabolised with CYP3A can increase systemic exposures of the glucocorticoids, and cases of Cushing’s syndrome and subsequent adrenal suppression have been reported with ritonavir-containing regimens. Concomitant use, particularly long-term use, should only be initiated if the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration may increase concentrations of fluticasone. Concomitant use with inhaled or nasal fluticasone may reduce serum cortisol concentrations.  Alternative corticosteroids should be considered, particularly for long term use.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Fluvastatin	DB01095	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Fluvastatin is a substrate of CYPs 2C9, 3A4, 2C8, and OATPs 1B1, 1B3 and BCRP. Exposure of fluvastatin may increase due to possible inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP by paritaprevir and ritonavir. No effect on concentrations of dasabuvir, ombitasvir or paritaprevir is expected. A temporary suspension of fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. If statin treatment is required, switch to dose reduced pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Note, use of fluvastatin in active liver disease is contraindicated.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of fluvastatin due to inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP by paritaprevir. Coadministration is not recommended. A temporary suspension of fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of treatment with Viekirax.

During coadministration abacavir exposures were up to 13% lower; lamuvidine Cmax and AUC were up to 13% lower and Ctrough was 29% higher. Exposure of ombitasvir and dasabuvir were up to 18% lower, and paritaprevir and ritonavir Ctrough both decreased by 34%. No dose adjustment is recommended for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir or abacavir/lamuvudine during coadministration.Drug-drug interactions of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r plus dasabuvir with dolutegravir or abacavir plus lamivudine.Khatn A, Trinh R, Zhao W, et al. 16th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV and Hepatitis Therapy, Washington DC, May 2015, Abstract 57.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Coadministration has not been studied but lamivudine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Given the findings from the interaction study conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir, along with the known similar elimination pathway for lamivudine, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction is not expected.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lamotrigine	DB00555	Lamotrigine is a substrate of UGT1A4. Atazanavir (UGT1A1 inhibitor) does not affect lamotrigine glucuronidation, however, atazanavir + ritonavir decreases lamotrigine AUC by 32%. A similar interaction is possible with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Monitor the subjects with adjustment of lamotrigine dose as appropriate.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lanreotide	DB06791	Coadministration has not been studied. The limited information available indicate that somatostatin analogues, such as lanreotide, may increase concentrations of CYP450 substrates. Given that ritonavir is present in the current regimen the effect of lanreotide may be limited, however an interaction cannot be excluded. Monitor for side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lansoprazole	DB00448	Coadministration has not been studied. Lansoprazole exposure may decrease when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Lansoprazole is a substrate of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Exposure of omeprazole, a model CYP2C19 substrate, decreased by 40-50% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir, but exposures of the DAAs were not affected. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with other CYP2C19 substrates. Monitor the subject for lack of response and increase the dose of lansoprazole if needed.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to decrease concentrations of lansoprazole due to induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. If clinically indicated higher doses of lansoprazole may be needed.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lapatinib	DB01259	Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Concentrations of lapatinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition by ritonavir. Lapatinib is an inhibitor of CYPs 3A4 and 2C8 but given the presence of ritonavir in this regimen it is unclear if there would be any additional increase in exposure of paritaprevir. Coadministration should be avoided if possible. If coadministration is unavoidable, a dose decrease of lapatinib will be required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is a complete regimen. There are no data to support the coadministration with other DAAs.	The safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir have been  established in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin.  Co-administration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with  other directly acting antivirals has not been studied and therefore  cannot be recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lercanidipine	DB00528	Avoid concomitant use with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Lercanidipine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase with ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased plasma levels of the eutomer S-lercanidipine (AUC by 15-fold, Cmax by 8-fold). Consequently, the lercanidipine product label says that coprescription of lercanidipine with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, erythromycin, troleandomycin) should be avoided.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Letrozole	DB01006	Coadministration has not been studied but letrozole is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of letrozole may increase due to inhibition CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Caution is advised and a dose titration may be required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Levetiracetam	DB01202	Coadministration has not been studied but levetiracetam can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Levetiracetam is metabolised by hydrolysis and is renally excreted.	(See Summary)

Levomepromazine is metabolised in part by CYP2D6. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Levothyroxine	DB00451	Coadministration has not been studied. Levothyroxine exposure may be increased due to UGT1A1 inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Levothyroxine is metabolised by sequential deiodination, glucuronidation and sulfation. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be carefully monitored in patients receiving levothyroxine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of levothyroxine due to inhibition of UGT1A1 by paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may be required for levothyroxine.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lidocaine (Lignocaine)	DB00281	Coadministration has not been studied. Lidocaine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of lidocaine may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing adverse effects (common adverse reactions are those from the central and peripheral nervous system). Therapeutic concentration monitoring should be done for lidocaine and a decrease in lidocaine dose maybe needed. Topical lidocaine can be used since there is minimal systemic absorption and adverse effects are averted.	Coadministration may increase concentrations of this antiarrhythmic. Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring (if available) is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Linaclotide	DB08890	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linaclotide is metabolised locally within the gastrointestinal tract and extensive studies have shown no CYP or transporter interactions occur.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Linagliptin	DB08882	Coadministration has not been studied. Linagliptin is a substrate and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. However data with ritonavir (a potent 3A4/P-gp inhibitor) indicated that despite an increase in exposure of linagliptin, a clinically relevant interaction would not be expected due to the large safety window of linagliptin.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Linezolid	DB00601	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linezolid is not metabolised by CYP450 and is not known to affect any of the key enzymes.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Liraglutide	DB06655	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lisinopril	DB00722	Coadministration has not been studied but lisinopril can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted entirely unchanged into the urine. Note, lisinopril exposure is increased in cirrhotic patients due to decreased clearance.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lithium	DB01356	Coadministration has not been studied but lithium can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Lithium is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lixisenatide	DB09265	Coadministration has not been studied. Lixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. However, delayed gastric emptying due to lixisenatide may reduce absorption of orally administered medicinal products. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Loperamide	DB00836	Coadministration has not been studied but loperamide can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Loperamide is substrate of P-gp but no significant interaction was observed with digoxin (a model P-gp substrate) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Note, use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment as no pharmacokinetic data are available and in such patients reduced first pass metabolism may result in a relative overdose leading to CNS toxicity.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Lopinavir	DB01601	Coadministration is contraindicated in the European product label and not recommended in the US product label. Lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily) in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir increased paritaprevir AUC by up to 2.2-fold. This is due to the higher total dose of ritonavir (300 mg/day).	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) decreased lopinavir Cmax and AUC by 13% and 6%, but increased Cmin by 15%. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 14%, 17% and 24 % respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.04-, 2.17- and 2.36-fold, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 1%, 7% and 32%, respectively. When lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg once daily administered in the evening) was coadministered, the effect on Cmax and AUC of DAAs and lopinavir was similar to that observed when lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily was administered. The increase in paritaprevir exposures may be due to inhibition of CYP3A/efflux transporters by lopinavir and higher dose of ritonavir. Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, is expected to increase paritaprevir plasma concentrations and must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 6 subjects.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Maprotiline	DB00934	Coadministration has not been studied but maprotiline can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Maprotiline is metabolised by CYP2D6; ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Maraviroc	DB04835	Coadministration has not been studied. Maraviroc is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in maraviroc dose may be needed as with other boosted regimens. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		MDMA (Ecstasy)		Coadministration has not been studied. MDMA (Ecstasy) is metabolised by CYP2D6; ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. However there have been fatalities reported in subjects taking ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitors and MDMA. Caution is strongly advised.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Mebeverine		Coadministration has not been studied but mebevirine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Mebevinine is metabolised by hydrolysis. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Mefenamic acid	DB00784	Coadministration has not been studied. Mefenamic acid is metabolised by CYP2C9 and conjugated with UGT2B7 and UGT1A9. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at steady-state did not affect the plasma exposures of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) so it is unlikely that it will affect mefenamic acid. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir does not affect UGT1A9 and UGT2B7.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Mefloquine	DB00358	Coadministration of mefloquine with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk due to QTc prolongation. Mefloquine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Co-administration of mefloquine (500 mg single oral dose) with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 10 days) in 8 healthy volunteers increased the mean Cmax and AUC of mefloquine by 64% and 79%, respectively. A similar interaction may occur with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Note, the European SPC for mefloquine (but not the US Prescribing Information) contraindicates the use of mefloquine in patients with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Melatonin	DB01065	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Melatonin is a substrate of CYP1A2 and concentrations may decrease due to induction of CYP1A2 by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. However, based on studies with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and duloxetine (a sensitive CYP1A2/CYP2D6 substrate), no a priori dose alteration is recommended. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Meloxicam	DB00814	Coadministration has not been studied. Meloxicam is a substrate of CYP2C9 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) and concentrations may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ondansetron	DB00904	Coadministration has not been studied but ondansetron can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Ondansetron is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Exposure of ondansetron was not affected by aprepitant, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As multiple enzymes are involved in the metabolism of ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination. Note, ondansetron clearance is significantly reduced and half-life significantly increased in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; in such patients a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded and parenteral or oral administration is recommended.

Monitor the subjects and either start with lower dose or consider a dose reduction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Oxycodone	DB00497	Coadministration has not been studied. Oxycodone is a substrate of CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased oxymorphone AUC by 3-fold and reduced noroxycodone and noroxymorphone AUCs by 80%. Inhibition of CYP3A4 resulted in metabolism by the CYP2D6 pathway. A similar effect could be anticipated with ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in oxycodone dose may be needed. Note, use of oxycodone in patients with moderate to severe hepatic failure is contraindicated in the European SPC but not in the US Prescribing Information.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Paliperidone	DB01267	Coadministration has not been studied. Paliperidone is a substrate of P-gp and concentrations may increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. However, there was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and digoxin, a model P-gp substrate and hence an interaction with paliperidone is not considered likely.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rabeprazole	DB01129	Coadministration has not been studied. Rabeprazole is a substrate of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Since omeprazole exposure decreased by 40-50% with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir a similar interaction may be expected with rabeprazole. Use higher doses of rabeprazole if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Raltegravir	DB06817	Raltegravir can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Raltegravir is a substrate of UGT1A1. Coadministration increased raltegravir Cmax and AUC by 133% and 134%, respectively. Exposures of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir were comparable to the historic data. Increases of up to 2 fold in raltegravir exposures are not clinically relevant for safety. Hence, no dose adjustment is necessary.	Coadministration with raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.33-, 2.34- and 2.00-fold respectively. The increase in raltegravir exposures may be due to UGT1A1 inhibition by paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir. The combination was not linked to any particular safety issues in a limited set of patients treated for 12-24 weeks. No clinically relevant changes in dasabuvir, paritaprevir and ombitasvir exposures (based on comparison with historical data) were observed during co-administration. No dose adjustment is necessary.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. No dose adjustments are recommended when ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are co-administered with raltegravir.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rifaximin	DB01220	Coadministration has not been studied. Rifaximin is an inducer of CYP3A4 and a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. Rifamixin did not show a clinically significant interaction with midazolam, a model CYP3A4 substrate, but exposure was about 10-, 13-and 20-fold higher in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy volunteers. Monitor subjects for an appropriate and expected response to rifamixin and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Note, caution should be exercised when rifamixin is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rilmenidine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as rilmenidine is not metabolised to any great extent.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rilpivirine	DB08864	Coadministration of rilpivirine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk due to potential for QT interval prolongation with higher concentrations of rilpivirine. Rilpivirine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure increased significantly (~3-fold increase in AUC) when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Coadministration should only be considered in patients without known QT-prolongation, and without other QT-prolongation co-medications. 	Rilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. If an HIV protease inhibitor is added (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even further and is therefore not recommended. Co-administration with rilpivirine once daily should only be considered in patients without known QT-prolongation, and without other QT-prolongation co-medications. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring. Coadministration with rilpivirine (25 mg once daily administered in the morning, with food) increased rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.55-, 3.25- and 3.62-fold, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 11%, 9% and 5%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC increased by 30% and 23%, but Cmin decreased by 5%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 18%, 17% and 10%, respectively. Rilpivirine was also administered in the evening with food and at night 4 hours after dinner in other two arms in the study. The effect on rilpivirine exposures was similar to that observed when rilpivirine was administered in the morning with food.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration with rilpivirine (25 mg once daily) was studied in 10 subjects. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 11%, 9% and 5%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC increased by 30% and 23%, but Cmin decreased by 5%. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC increased by 10% and 8%, but Cmin decreased by 3%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 18%, 17% and 10%. Rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.55-, 3.25- and 3.62-fold, respectively. Similar increases were observed when rilpivirine was dosed in the evening with food or 4 hours after food. Co-administration with rilpivirine once daily is not recommended due to potential for QT interval prolongation with higher concentrations of rilpivirine.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rimantadine	DB00478	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Rimantadine undergoes complex liver metabolism being both hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Although ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir can affect some CYP and UGT pathways, due to multiple enzyme pathways involved in the metabolism of rimantadine, a clinically significant interaction is not expected.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Risedronate	DB00884	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. There is no evidence of systemic metabolism of risedronate; 60% of the dose is distributed to bone and the remainder is excreted in urine. However the absorption of risedronate may be affected by food, drinks (other than plain water) or other medicinal products. Risendronate should be taken at least 2 hours before and at least 2 hours after any food, medicinal product or drink.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Risperidone	DB00734	Coadministration has not been studied. Risperidone is a substrate and inhibitor of CYPs 2D6, 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 3 A4. At 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased the AUC of risperidone and its metabolite by 66% and 48%, respectively. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in risperidone dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ritonavir	DB00503	Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir is a complete regimen containing ritonavir. Coadministration with additional ritonavir is not recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rituximab	DB00073	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is not expected as rituximab is removed by opsonization via the reticularendothelial system. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rivaroxaban	DB06228	Coadministration has not been studied. Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. Ritonavir increased rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax by 150% and 60%, respectively. Similar increases in pharmacodynamic effects (i.e., factor Xa inhibition and PT prolongation) were also observed. Significant increases in rivaroxaban exposure may increase bleeding risk. Rivoroxaban label recommends avoiding use with ritonavir. Use alternative if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rizatriptan	DB00953	Coadministration has not been studied but rizatriptan can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Rizatriptan is metabolised by MAO.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Ropinirole	DB00268	Coadministration has not been studied. Ropinirole is a substrate of CYP1A2. Exposure of ropinirole may be decreased with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir due to induction of CYP1A2 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)

The European product label recommends that the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin should be 5 mg whereas the US product label advises that the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg per day. Note, rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients who consume excessive quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease.	Coadministration with rosuvastatin (5 mg once daily) increased rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC by 7.13- and 2.59-fold, but Cmin decreased by 41% due to OATP1B inhibition by paritaprevir and BCRP inhibition by paritaprevir, ritonavir or dasabuvir. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 8%, 11% and 12%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 59%, 52% and 43%, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 7%, 8% and 15%, respectively. If rosuvastatin treatment is required during the treatment period, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin should be 5 mg.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration with rosuvastatin (5 mg once daily) was studied in 11 subjects. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 8%, 11% and 12%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 59%, 52% and 43%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax decreased by 2%, AUC increased by 2% and there was no change in Cmin. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 7%, 8% and 15%, respectively. Rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC increased by 7.13- and 2.59-fold, but Cmin decreased by 41%. When VIEKIRA PAK is co-administered with rosuvastatin, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg per day.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Rufinamide	DB06201	Coadministration has not been studied but would not be recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Rufinamide is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and may decrease exposures of components of the DAA regimen which may lead to loss of virologic response. It is difficult to predict the overall effect of CYP3A4 induction on DAA exposure in the presence of ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Tacrolimus	DB00864	Tacrolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir increased tacrolimus Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 4-fold, 57-fold and 16-fold, respectively. Therapeutic monitoring is required. To maintain Ctrough in the therapeutic range, administer 0.5 mg/week when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Monitor tacrolimus levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed. 	Coadministration increased tacrolimus Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 3.99-, 57.1- and 16.6-fold (tacrolimus 2 mg dosed alone, 2 mg coadministered; dose normalized tacrolimus ratios are shown). Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 7%, 6% and 6%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 43%, 34% and 27%, respectively. Dasabuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 15% and 10%, but Cmin increased by 1%. The effect on tacrolimus is due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. When starting co-administration, administer 0.5 mg tacrolimus once every week. Monitor tacrolimus levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration with tacrolimus (2 mg single dose) was studied in 12 subjects. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 7%, 6% and 6%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 43%, 34% and 27%, respectively. Ritonavir Cmax and AUC decreased by 24% and 13%, but Cmin increased by 3%. Dasabuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 15% and 10%, but Cmin increased by 1%. Tacrolimus Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 3.99-, 57.1- and 16.56-fold, respectively. When initiating therapy with Viekira Pak®, the dose of tacrolimus needs to be reduced.  Do not administer tacrolimus on the day Viekira Pak® is initiated. Beginning the day after Viekira Pak® is initiated; reinitiate tacrolimus at a reduced dose based on tacrolimus blood concentrations.  Typical tacrolimus dosing is 0.5 mg every 7 days. Measure tacrolimus blood concentrations and adjust dose or dosing frequency to determine subsequent dose modifications.  Upon completion of Viekira Pak® therapy, the appropriate time to resume pre-therapy dose of tacrolimus should be guided by assessment of tacrolimus blood concentrations. Frequent assessment of renal function and tacrolimus related side effects is recommended.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Tadalafil (erectile dysfunction)	DB00820	Coadministration has not been studied.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Tamoxifen	DB00675	Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Tamsulosin	DB00706	Coadministration has not been studied. Tamsulosin is a substrate of CYP3A4.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Tolterodine	DB01036	Coadministration has not been studied. Tolterodine is metabolised by CYP2D6 or by CYP3A4 in individuals who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers.  In such subjects, coadministration may increase tolterodine concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. The European SPC for tolterodine advises that coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided whereas the US Prescribing Information recommends a maximum tolterodine dose of 1 mg twice daily.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Topiramate	DB00273	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Topiramate is mainly eliminated by renal elimination in unchanged form (up to 60% of the dose) and partly by oxidation. Weak induction of CYP isozymes has been observed with higher doses of topiramate but this is not considered to be of clinical relevance with ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Torasemide	DB00214	Coadministration has not been studied but torasemide can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alternation is required. Torasemide is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.

No a priori dose adjustment is required with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Perform therapeutic drug monitoring and adjust if required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Valsartan	DB00177	Coadministration has not been studied. Valsartan is a substrate of OATP1B1. Valsartan exposure may increase when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir due to OATP1B1 inhibition by paritaprevir. Consider dose reduction and monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Note, the European SPC for valsartan states a maximum dose of 80 mg in mild to moderate hepatic impairment, but the US Prescribing Information states no dosage requirement in this level of impairment.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase valsartan concentrations due to inhibition of OATP1B by paritaprevir. Clinical monitoring and dose reduction is recommended when coadministered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vancomycin	DB00512	Coadministration has not been studied but vancomycin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. Vancomycin is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vardenafil	DB00862	Coadministration has not been studied. Vardenafil is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposures may increase with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. This may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual changes, and prolonged erection. Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2.5 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Varenicline	DB01273	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as varenicline is predominantly eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		The safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir have been established in combination with ribavirin. Coadministration with other directly acting antivirals has not been studied and therefore cannot be recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Venlafaxine	DB00285	Coadministration has not been studied. Venlafaxine is a substrate of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-gp. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4/P-gp, increased exposure of venlafaxine and its metabolite by 20-141%. A similar magnitude of increase may be seen due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in venlafaxine dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Verapamil	DB00661	Coadministration has not been studied. Verapamil is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Concentrations of paritaprevir may increase, but the efffect on dasabuvir is unclear (no change or concentrations may increase). Use with caution due to the expected increase in paritaprevir exposures. Monitor the subjects. Start with the lowest possible dose. Clinical monitoring of calcium channel blockers is recommended when co-administered.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of verapamil and paritaprevir due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp, and may increase (or have no effect on) concentrations of dasabuvir. Caution is advised due to the expected increase in paritaprevir exposures. Dose decrease and clinical monitoring of calcium channel blockers is recommended when co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vernakalant		Coadministration has not been studied. Vernakalant is metabolised by CYP2D6 and UGTs. Although at a 100 mg dose ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6 caution is recommended since glucuronidation can also be inhibited by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and currently it is not clear which isozymes are involved. Given the potential risk of QT prolongation with vernakalant, caution is advised.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vigabatrin	DB01080	Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as vigabatrin is not metabolised and is cleared mainly by glomerular filtration.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vildagliptin	DB04876	Coadministration has not been studied but vildagliptin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vinblastine	DB00570	Coadministration has not been studied. Vinblastine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in the potential for increased adverse events usually associated with vinblastine. Carefully monitor the subjects. Consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir containing regimen in patients who develop significant haematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when ritonavir is administered concurrently with vinblastine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vincristine	DB00541	Coadministration has not been studied. Vincristine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in the potential for increased adverse events usually associated with vincristine. Carefully monitor the subjects. Consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir containing regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when ritonavir is administered concurrently with vincristine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vinorelbine	DB00361	Coadministration has not been studied. Vinorelbine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Use with extreme caution and monitor closely for toxicity as increased concentrations may increase the risk and severity of autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, and myelosuppression.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vitamin E	DB00163	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as vitamin E is minimally metabolised by the liver.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Voriconazole	DB00582	Coadministration has not been studied. Voriconazole is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Ritonavir alone decreased voriconazole Cmax and AUC by 24% and 39%, respectively which may lead to loss of antifungal response. Concentrations of dasabuvir and paritaprevir are expected to increase. Coadministration is contraindicated in the European product label but the US product label advises that coadministration is not recommended unless the benefit-to-risk ratio justifies the use of voriconazole. These interaction charts reflect the more cautious option.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but in CYP2C19 extensive metabolisers it is expected to decrease voriconazole concentrations and increase concentrations of paritaprevir and dasabuvir. In CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, coadministration is expected to increase concentrations of voriconazole, dasabuvir and paritaprevir. This is due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as voriconazole, is expected to increase paritaprevir plasma concentrations and must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. Coadministration may decrease concentrations of voriconazole. Co-administration with voriconazole is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit-to-risk ratio justifies the use of voriconazole. Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Vortioxetine	DB09068	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Vortioexetine is primarily metabolised by CYP2D6, with minor involvement from CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Warfarin	DB00682	Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and warfarin can be coadministered with close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR). Warfarin is a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir had no significant effect on the plasma exposures of S-warfarin or R-warfarin. Coadministration with warfarin (5 mg single dose) increased R-warfarin Cmax by 5%, but decreased AUC and Cmin by 12% and 6%; the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of S-warfarin decreased by 4%, 12% and 5%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 6%, 4% and 2%. Paritaprevir Cmax and Cmin decreased by 2% and 4%, but AUC increased by 7%. Dasabuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 3% and 2%, but Cmin increased by 3%. However, a case report describes a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) becoming subtherapeutic two weeks after starting ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with ribavirin. Close monitoring is recommended as dose modifications may be necessary in some patients.	Coadministration with warfarin (5 mg single dose) increased R-warfarin Cmax by 5%, but decreased AUC and Cmin by 12% and 6%; the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of S-warfarin decreased by 4%, 12% and 5%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 6%, 4% and 2%. Paritaprevir Cmax and Cmin decreased by 2% and 4%, but AUC increased by 7%. Dasabuvir Cmax and AUC decreased by 3% and 2%, but Cmin increased by 3%. While no dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin, appropriate monitoring of international normalised ratio (INR) is recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.No dose adjustments are recommended when ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are co-administered with warfarin.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.A case report describes a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) becoming subtherapeutic two weeks after starting ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with ribavirin, Eleven weeks into therapy and following a 125% total increase in the weekly warfarin dose, therapeutic INR was achieved. Thirteen days after DAA therapy was completed and discontinued, the patient's INR became critically supratherapeutic.

OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Zolpidem	DB00425	Coadministration with zolpidem (5 mg single dose) had no significant effect on exposures of zolpidem (Cmax and AUC decreased by 6% and 5%) nor on ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir. Zolpidem can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and no dose alteration is required. 	Coadministration with zolpidem (5 mg single dose) decreased zolpidem Cmax and AUC by 6% and 5%. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 7%, 3% and 4%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 37% and 32%, but Cmin increased by 23%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 7%, 5% and 8%, respectively. No dose adjustments are necessary.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015. No dose adjustments are recommended when ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are co-administered with zolpidem.Viekira Pak US Prescribing Information, AbbVie, December 2014.
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Zonisamide	DB00909	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as zonisamide is a weak P-gp inhibitor and any clinical significance is unclear.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Zopiclone	DB01198	Coadministration has not been studied. Zopiclone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure increased by 80% with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. A greater magnitude of interaction is expected with ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Coadministration of eszopiclone (its structural analogue) with ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased eszopiclone exposure by 2.2-fold. Monitor the subjects. Start with a lowest possible dose of zopiclone. Note, elimination of zopiclone may be reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction and a lower dose of zopiclone nightly is recommended for these patients. Zopiclone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r + DSV		Zuclopentixol		Coadministration has not been studied. Zuclopenthixol exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Zuclopenthixol is a substrate of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and UGT, but the relative contribution of each metabolic pathway is unknown. Monitor the subjects. Start with a lowest possible dose of zuclopenthixol.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Abacavir	DB01048	Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir has not been studied. Coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and abacavir/lamivudine (600/300 mg once daily) was studied in 12 HIV/HCV-negative subjects and had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, dasabuvir, abacavir or lamivudine. No dose adjustment is required for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir or abacavir during coadministration.	Coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir and  abacavir/lamivudine (600/300 mg once daily) was studied in 12  HIV/HCV-negative subjects. During coadministration abacavir exposures  were up to 13% lower; lamuvidine Cmax and AUC were up to 13% lower and  Ctrough was 29% higher. Exposure of ombitasvir and dasabuvir were up to  18% lower, and paritaprevir and ritonavir Ctrough both decreased by 34%.  No dose adjustment is recommended for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir  + dasabuvir or abacavir/lamuvudine during coadministration.Drug-drug interactions of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r plus dasabuvir with dolutegravir or abacavir plus lamivudine.Khatn  A, Trinh R, Zhao W, et al. 16th International Workshop on Clinical  Pharmacology of HIV and Hepatitis Therapy, Washington DC, May 2015,  Abstract 57.
OBV/PTV/r		Acamprosate	DB00659	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acamprosate does not undergo significant metabolism.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Acarbose	DB00284	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. After ingestion of acarbose the majority of active unchanged drug remains in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to exert its pharmacological effect and is metabolised by intestinal enzymes and by the gut microflora.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Acebutolol	DB01193	Coadministration has not been studied. Acebutolol is mainly excreted in the urine as diacetolol and is substrate of P-gp in vitro. Exposure may increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. There was an increase in exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin and a similar change may occur with acebutolol.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Acenocoumarol	DB01418	Coadministration has not been studied. Acenocoumarol is a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at steady-state did not affect the plasma exposures of the anticoagulant warfarin which is metabolised in a similar way. However, a case report describes a patient who required a significant increase in acenocoumarol weekly dose probably due to an interaction with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and/or dasabuvir. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and acenocoumarol can be coadministered but with close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) as dose modifications may be necessary in some patients.	A case was reported of a patient who required a significant increase in acenocoumarol weekly dose probably due to an interaction with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and/or dasabuvir. A causality assessment of the drug-drug interaction leading to a reduced INR was conducted according to the Naranjo algorithm. A score of 6 suggested that the adverse drug reaction was probable. Because of possible INR abnormalities during the concomitant use of acenocoumarol, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, clinicians should closely monitor INR values.Decreased INR after acenocoumarol, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir co-administration. de Lorenzo-Pinto A, Giménez-Manzorro Á, Rodríguez-González CG, et al.

OBV/PTV/r		Acitretin	DB00459	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerization and conjugation by UGT1A9. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is not known to affect this enzyme.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Adefovir		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as adefovir undergoes renal elimination.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Agomelatine	DB06594	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatine is metabolized predominantly by CYP1A2. Note, agomelatine is contraindicated in hepatic impairment as increases in exposure of 140-fold have been seen in cirrhotic patients.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Albendazole	DB00518	Coadministration has not been studied but may reduce the clinical effect of albendazole. Coadministration with ritonavir alone (200 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC of albendazole and the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide by 73% and 59%, respectively, with Cmax decreasing by 74% and 48%, respectively.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Albiglutide	DB09043	Coadministration has not been studied. Albiglutide delays gastric emptying and therefore may affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. The clinical effect of this is unknown.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Alendronic acid	DB00630	Coadministration has not been studied but alendronate can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Alendronate is not metabolised and is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. Although no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, note that alendronate should be separated from food or other medicinal products and therefore should be separated from ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir administration.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Alfentanil	DB00802	Coadministration has not been studied but alfentanil concentrations may be increased since it is a substrate of CYP3A4. Careful monitoring of therapeutic response and adverse effects (including respiratory depression) is recommended, especially at initiation of treatment. A dosage adjustment of alfentanil may be required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Alfuzosin	DB00346	Coadministration is contraindicated. Alfuzosin is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4. Exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing potential hypotension.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase alfuzosin concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as alfuzosin, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Aliskiren	DB09026	Coadministration of aliskiren with P-gp inhibitors (such as ritonavir) is not recommended. Aliskiren is transported by P-gp and shows a 5-6 fold increase in exposure with itraconazole 100 mg twice daily (a CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor). A similar interaction is possible with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. The aliskiren label recommends avoiding concomitant use with CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Allopurinol	DB00437	Coadministration has not been studied but allopurinol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required.

(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Almotriptan	DB00918	Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies indicate a minor role for CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in the metabolism of almotriptan. It is possible that coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir may increase almotriptan concentrations through inhibition by ritonavir and clinical monitoring for an increase in side effects is suggested. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Aloe vera		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Aloe vera is only a weak inhibitor of CYPs in vitro and therefore is unlikely to cause clinically significant interactions. It does not inhibit P-gp and there is no evidence to suggest it impacts UGTs.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Alogliptin	DB06203	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Alogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism and is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine and metabolism by CYPs is minimal. No transporter interactions have been described.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Alprazolam	DB00404	Coadministration has not been studied. However alprazolam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its AUC increased by 34% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. A decrease in dose may be considered based on clinical response.	Coadministration with Viekirax alone has not been studied but a similar effect is expected as observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir with alprazolam (0.5 mg single dose) increased alprazolam Cmax and AUC by 9% and 34% due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Ombitasvir Cmax and Cmin both decreased by 2% and there was no change in AUC. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 9% and 4% with Cmin increasing by 12%. Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. A decrease in alprazolam dose can be considered based on clinical response. No dose adjustment is need for Viekirax.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Aluminium hydroxide		Coadministration has not been studied but antacids can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. DAA exposures were not affected in the presence of an acid reducing agent such as omeprazole or metal chelators.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Alverine citrate		Coadministration has not been studied but based on limited understanding of metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. However as alverine citrate affects gastric motility, an effect on the absorption of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir cannot be ruled out. Doses of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and alverine should be separated by 4 hours if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Amantadine	DB00915	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as amantadine is only metabolized to a minor extent (principally N-acetylation) and is largely excreted unchanged in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ambrisentan	DB06403	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase ambrisentan concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The clinical significance of this is unknown and in the absence of further data, monitor for increased ambrisentan side effects.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Anagrelide	DB00261	Coadministration has not been studied. Angarelide is metabolised by CYP1A2 and concentrations may decrease due to induction of CYP1A2 by ritonavir. Monitor for efficacy and consider a dose increase if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Anastrozole	DB01217	Coadministration has not been studied. Anastrozole is metabolized by multiple enzyme pathways and a clinically significant interaction is not expected.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Anidulafungin	DB00362	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as anidulafungin is not hepatically metabolized.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Antacids		Coadministration has not been studied but antacids can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. DAA exposures were not affected in the presence of an acid reducing agent such as omeprazole or metal chelators.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Apixaban	DB06605	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Concentrations of apixaban are expected to increase due to potent CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition by ritonavir. Increased concentrations of apixiban increase the bleeding risk and the combination should be avoided if possible. No effect on ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is expected.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Aprepitant	DB00673	Coadministration has not been studied. Aprepitant is a substrate, inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4 and also inhibits CYP2C9. Aprepitant exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir may decrease due to CYP3A4 induction by aprepitant. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in aprepitant dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Aripiprazole	DB01238	Coadministration has not been studied. Aripiprazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Aripiprazole exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in aripiprazole dose may be needed. The aripiprazole label suggests decreasing the dose by one-half when administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Artemether	DB06697	Coadministration has not been studied. Artemether is a substrate of CYP3A4 and exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor for increased side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Artemisinin		Coadministration has not been studied. Artemisinin induces CYP3A4 and there is the possibility of a decrease in exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir although it is difficult to judge the clinical relevance.  Monitor for therapeutic effect.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Artesunate	DB09274	Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydroartemisinin (the active metabolite of artesunate) induces CYP3A4 and there is the possibility of a decrease in exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir although it is difficult to judge the clinical relevance. Monitor for therapeutic effect.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as ascorbic acid is largely hydrolysed to salicylic acid followed by conjugation with either glycine or glucuronic acid.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Aspirin		Coadministration has not been studied but aspirin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Aspirin is metabolised by deacetylation and UGT2B7 conjugation.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Astemizole	DB00637	Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Astemizole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase astemizole concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as astemizole, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Atazanavir	DB01072	Coadministration of atazanavir (alone or with ritonavir or cobicistat) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is not recommended due to a near 3-fold increase in paritaprevir exposure seen with atazanavir alone. This may be due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1/B3 by atazanavir. 	Treatment with atazanavir and Viekirax without dasabuvir is not recommended due to increased paritaprevir exposure. Coadministration with atazanavir (300 mg once daily, given at the same time) increased paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 46%, 94% and 226%. The increase in paritaprevir exposure may be due to inhibition of OATP1B1/B3 and CYP3A by atazanavir. Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Atenolol	DB00335	Coadministration has not been studied but atenolol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Atenolol is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Atomoxetine	DB00289	Coadministration has not been studied. Atomoxetine is a substrate of CYP2D6 but at 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Atomoxetine's active metabolite, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, is a substrate of UGT and, theoretically, its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in atomoxetine dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Atorvastatin	DB01076	Coadministration is contraindicated. Atorvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and OATP1B1 by paritaprevir, causing toxicity (elevation of hepatic enzymes, GI effects, muscle weakness, myalgia, muscle cramps, myopathy, elevation of CPK, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria leading to renal insufficiency).	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of atorvastatin due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and OATP1B. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as atorvastatin, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Atovaquone	DB01117	Atovaquone exposure may decrease when co-administered with ritonavir. The coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir with atovaquone led to a decrease in atovaquone AUC of 74%. Monitor the subjects. An increase in atovaquone dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Atropine	DB00572	Coadministration has not been studied. Atropine metabolism has not been well described but is thought to be by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites and up to 50% is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely; however, by possibly delaying gastric emptying, atropine may alter the absorption of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir but the clinical significance of this is unknown.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Azathioprine	DB00993	Coadministration has not been studied but azathioprine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. There is no overlap of metabolic pathways, so no interaction is expected. However note that azathioprine has an interaction with ribavirin such that if ribavirin is part of the regimen it is important to refer to the summary information given for ribavirin and azathioprine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Azilsartan		Azilsartan can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Azilsartan is a substrate of CYP2C9 but there was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate. Therefore, no interaction is expected with azilsartan.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Azithromycin	DB00207	Coadministration has not been studied. Azithromycin may theoretically interact with the paritaprevir component of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir via MRP2 but no dose alteration is required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Aztreonam	DB00355	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug interaction is unlikely. Aztreonam is only minimally metabolised and is eliminated mainly unchanged in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Baclofen	DB00181	Coadministration has not been studied but baclofen can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Baclofen is mainly excreted in the urine or deaminated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Basilixumab		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Basiliximab is an immunoglobulin and no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected. Extensive studies have been carried out with concomitant medication showing no adverse effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Beclometasone		Coadministration has not been studied but beclometasone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Beclometasone is metabolised by hydrolysis to beclometasone 17-monopropionate in vivo although it is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. No evidence of adrenal suppression was observed with either darunavir/ritonavir or ritonavir and beclometasone.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Benazepril	DB00542	Coadministration has not been studied. Benazepril is a substrate of UGTs (the specific UGTs have not been well described) and its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. The exposure of raltegravir (a UGT substrate) was increased by up to 2-fold with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir; a similar interaction is possible with other UGT substrates. In the absence of further data, monitor cardiac parameters and for increased side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bendroflumethiazide	DB00436	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Bendroflumethiazide is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism, although the exact pathway is not known. It is unlikely that CYP enzymes are involved in this process and no transporter interactions have been described.	(See Summary0
OBV/PTV/r		Benztropine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Benztropine is primarily metabolised by CYP2D6, with minor involvement from CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Benzylpenicillin	DB01053	Coadministration has not been studied but benzylpenicillin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Benzylpenicillin is mainly excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bepridil	DB01244	Do not coadminister unless unavoidable. Bepridil is a substrate of CYP3A4 and exposure may markedly increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in the potential for serious and/or life threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. If coadministration is warranted, use with caution and therapeutic concentration monitoring (if available) is recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Betamethasone	DB00443	Coadministration has not been studied. Betamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. A significant betamethasone dose reduction is recommended. Monitor the subject closely for corticosteroid side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bezafibrate	DB01393	Coadministration has not been studied. Bezafibrate is metabolised by hydroxylation, glucuronidation and renal elimination (~50%). Due to involvement of multiple metabolic pathways and renal elimination, a clinically significant interaction is not expected with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Note, the European SPC for bezafibrate contraindicates its use in significant hepatic disease.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bilastine	DB11591	Coadministration has not been studied. Bilastine is not significantly metabolized and is mainly excreted in the urine. In-vitro studies show that bilastine is a substrate of P-gp and exposure may increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. There was an increase in exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin and a similar change may occur with bilastine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bisacodyl	DB09020	Coadministration has not been studied. Bisacodyl increases colonic mass movements and may affect absorption of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. The potential interaction can be resolved by giving bisacodyl at least 4 hours after ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bisoprolol	DB00612	Coadministration has not been studied. Bisoprolol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in bisoprolol dose may be needed. Note, the European product label for bisoprolol recommends a maximum of 10 mg in severe hepatic impairment; the US Prescribing Information recommends an initial 2.5 mg in hepatic impairment with caution in further dose titration.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Boceprevir	DB08873	Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is a complete regimen. There are no data to support the coadministration with other DAAs.	Viekirax safety and efficacy have been established in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin. Co-administration of Viekirax with other directly acting antivirals has not been studied and therefore cannot be recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Bortezomib	DB00188	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase bortezomib concentrations due to inhibition of CYP34 by ritonavir. Coadministration with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased bortezomib AUC by 35%. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bosentan	DB00559	Avoid use of bosentan with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Bosentan is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and OATPs 1B1 and 1B3. Bosentan exposure increased 30-fold when administered with cyclosporine, an OATP1B1 inhibitor. Paritaprevir is also an OATP1B1 inhibitor and a similar interaction is expected with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Bosentan exposure increased 5-fold and metabolite levels were undetectable due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and liver problems. Thus, in addition to the OATP1B interaction potential, there is also CYP3A4 interaction potential. Use an alternative to bosentan.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Brivudine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as brivudine is an analog of thymidine and is incorporated into viral DNA. The metabolism of brivudine is poorly described but to date there is no evidence of CYP or P-gp involvement.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bromazepam	DB01558	Coadministration has not been studied but bromazepam can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Bromazepam is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromazepam were not affected by itraconazole, suggesting that CYP3A4 is not involved in the metabolism of bromazepam to a major extent. Thus, no interaction is expected with ritonavir. There is also no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin, a CYP2C9/CYP1A2 substrate. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bromocriptine	DB01200	Coadministration has not been studied. Bromocritpine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in bromocriptine dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bromperidol		Coadministration has not been studied. Bromperidol is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Monitor for signs and symptoms of increased concentrations.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Budesonide	DB01222	Concomitant administration of ritonavir and glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with inhaled or intranasally administered budesonide. Use beclometasone as an alternative. Budesonide is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing a decrease in plasma cortisol leading to Cushing's syndrome. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bumetanide	DB00887	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as bumetanide is mainly excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Bupivacaine	DB00297	Coadministration has not been studied. Bupivacaine is metabolised by UGT1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, and amide hydrolysis. Due to the involvement of UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 an increase in bupivacaine concentrations may occur. Monitor clinically and consider dose reduction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Buprenorphine	DB00921	Buprenorphine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no a priori dose alteration is required. Buprenorphine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. There was an increase of 51% in buprenorphine AUC when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.  There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir or paritaprevir based on cross-study comparison. Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects.	Coadministration with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) increased buprenorphine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 19%, 51% and 65%, respectively. The magnitude of interaction for norbuprenorphine and naloxone was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir (norbuprenorphine Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.07-, 1.84- and 2.10-fold; naloxone Cmax and AUC increased by 18% and 28%; dose normalised parameters reported). The increases were due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and UGT inhibition by paritaprevir and ombitasvir. There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir or paritaprevir based on cross-study comparison. No dose adjustment is necessary.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Bupropion	DB01156	Coadministration has not been studied. No interaction was observed between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and methadone (CYP2B6 substrate). Hence, it is not expected to interact with other CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion. Short-term ritonavir (200 mg; 4 doses over 2 days) dosing has only minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion while long term administration of low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) doses has shown only ≤22% decrease in bupropion exposures. However, monitor the subjects and adjust bupropion dose if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Buspirone	DB00490	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of buspirone due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Using the lowest dose possible of buspirone is recommended, starting at 2.5mg. Monitor for increased side effects such as impaired psychomotor performance, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness and miosis and decrease dose if symptomatic. Use with caution in cirrhosis.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Calcitonin		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Calcitonin is metabolised primarily via proteolysis in the kidney.and to date no clinically significant interactions have been published that would be of concern.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Calcium resonium		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as calcium resonium is not absorbed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Canagliflozin	DB08907	Coadministration has not been studied. Canagliflozin is a substrate of UGTs and P-gp and its exposure may increase due to inhibition of UGTs and P-gp by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. There was an increase in exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin and a similar change may occur with canagliflozin. Monitor blood glucose.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Candesartan	DB00796	Coadministration has not been studied. Candesartan is mainly excreted in urine and is a substrate of OATP1B1. Candesartan exposure may increase due to OATP1B1 inhibition by the paritaprevir and ritonavir components of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Consider dose reduction and monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Note, use of candesartan in severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated in the European SPC; the US Prescribing Information recommends caution in moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cannabis		Coadministration has not been studied. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis) is metabolised mainly by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir may increase concentrations of THC by ritonavir inhibition of CYP3A4. The patient should be made aware of potential increased side effects. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Capecitabine	DB01101	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Capecitabine is a substrate of CYP2C9. There was no interaction between and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Capreomycin	DB00314	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as capreomycin is mainly excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Captopril	DB01197	Coadministration has not been studied but captopril can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Captopril is metabolised by sulfation and approximately 40-50% is excreted in the urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Carbamazepine	DB00564	Coadministration is contraindicated. Carbamazepine is a substrate and inducer of CYPs 3A4, 2C8 and 1A2. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir exposures show a significant decrease when administered with carbamazepine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir (ombitasvir Cmax and AUC both decreased by 31%; paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 66% and 70%) which may lead to virologic failure. 	Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers, such as carbamazepine, is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered. Coadministration with Viekirax alone has not been studied but a similar effect is expected as observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir with carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily) increased carbamazepine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 10%, 17% and 35%, respectively, with the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide decreasing by 16%, 25% and 43%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax and AUC both decreased by 31%. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 66% and 70%. Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Carbidopa	DB00190	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carbidopa is partly metabolized and partly eliminated unchanged (30% of the total urinary excretion).	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Carbimazole	DB00389	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carbimazole is a pro-drug which undergoes rapid and virtually complete metabolism to the active metabolite, thiamazole (methimazole). There is little evidence of marked interactions with this drug.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Carboplatin	DB00958	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Carboplatin is excreted primarily by renal glomerular filtration. In vitro studies have shown that carboplatin does not significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Carisoprodol	DB00395	Coadministration has not been studied. Carisoprodol is a substrate of CYP2C19 and its exposure may decrease due to CYP2C19 induction by ritonavir. Exposure of omeprazole, a model CYP2C19 substrate, decreased by ~50% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir but exposures of each component of the DAA regimen were not affected. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with other CYP2C19 substrates. If coadministered, a higher dose of carisoprodol can be considered, if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Carvedilol	DB01136	Coadministration has not been studied. Carvedilol undergoes glucuronidation via UGTs 1A1, 2B4 and 2B7 and additionally metabolism via CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYPs 2C9 and 1A2. The net effect on carvedilol concentrations is difficult to predict. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir could potentially increase carvedilol concentrations. Monitor clinical effect. Note, the US Prescribing Information contraindicates carvedilol in patients with severe liver impairment and the European SPC contraindicates it in patients with hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Caspofungin	DB00520	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as caspofungin undergoes spontaneous chemical degradation and non-CYP medicated metabolism. Note, no dose adjustment is required in patients with normal hepatic function but a dose reduction of caspofungin daily dose to 35 mg is recommended for adults with moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in adults with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cefaclor	DB00833	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug interaction is unlikely. Cefaclor is predominantly eliminated unchanged by the kidneys.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Ceftriaxone	DB01212	Coadministration has not been studied but ceftriaxone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Ceftriaxone is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cefuroxime	DB01112	Coadministration has not been studied but cefuroxime can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Cefuroxime is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Celecoxib	DB00482	Coadministration has not been studied but celecoxib can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Celecoxib is a substrate of CYP2C9. There was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate so no interaction is expected with celecoxib. Note, use in patients with severe liver impairment is contraindicated in the European SPC and not recommended in the US Prescribing Information. In patients with moderate liver impairment (serum albumin 25-35 g/L, Child-Pugh Class B), celecoxib treatment should be started at half the recommended dose.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Celiprolol	DB04846	Coadministration has not been studied but celiprolol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Celiprolol is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and faeces.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cetirizine	DB00341	Coadministration has not been studied. Cetirizine is metabolised only to a limited extent and is eliminated unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Cetirizine is also transported by P-gp and exposure may theoretically increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. There was an increase in exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin and a similar change may occur with cetirizine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chlorambucil	DB00291	Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is considered unlikely. Very little has been described about chlorambucil metabolism in humans but CYP450 enzymes are not involved.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chloramphenicol	DB00446	Coadministration has not been studied. Chloramphenicol eye drops can be used for short term treatment. Chloramphenicol is an inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and is mainly excreted in urine. Inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of some co-administered drugs and could theoretically interact with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Avoid unless benefit outweighs the risk.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chloroquine	DB00608	Coadministration has not been studied. Following administration, chloroquine is rapidly metabolised by CYPs 2C8, 3A and 2D6 to desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine which have activity similar to chloroquine. Chloroquine is also renally eliminated. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir may decrease exposure to the active metabolites, but this may not affect overall activity. No a priori dosage adjustment is recommended for chloroquine. Note, the European SPC and US Prescribing Information for chloroquine both recommend caution in impaired hepatic function.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chlorothiazide	DB00880	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Chlorothiazide is not metabolised and is eliminated rapidly by renal excretion.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chlorphenamine	DB01114	Coadministration has not been studied. Chlorphenamine is a substrate of CYP2D6 with possible involvement of CYP3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. While no a priori dose adjustment is required, monitor for increased side-effects while co-administering chlorphenamine with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chlorpromazine	DB00477	Coadministration has not been studied. Chlorpromazine is a substrate of CYPs 2D6 (major), 1A2 and 3A4 in vitro. Chlorpromazine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 and possibly CYP2D6 inhibition by ritonavir. No a priori dose modification is needed, but monitor the subjects and dose decrease if required. Note, the European SPC for chlorpromazine advises that its use should be avoided in patients with hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Chlortalidone		Coadministration has not been studied but chlortalidone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Chlortalidone is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ciclesonide	DB01410	Ciclesonide can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir without dose adjustment, but with close monitoring. There is a risk of steroid side effects occurring, particularly if a high dose is used or if used with another medicine containing corticosteroids. These side effects are also more likely during periods of physiological stress. Ciclesonide is substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 7 days) with orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 µg once daily) resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the AUC and a 2-fold increase in the Cmax of des-ciclesonide, the active metabolite of ciclesonide. Concentrations of the parent ciclesonide were not significantly altered. Ciclesonide is mainly absorbed by lungs and hence interaction with ketoconazole would not require any dosage/therapy adjustments due to the low potential of ciclesonide to cause systemic effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ciclosporin		Ciclosporin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir increased ciclosporin AUC and Cmin by 4-fold and 12-fold and increased paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 39%, 46% and 18%, respectively. Give one-fifth of the total daily dose of ciclosporin once daily with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor ciclosporin levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed. 	Coadministration with ciclosporin decreased ciclosporin Cmax by 17%, but increased AUC and Cmin by 4.28- and 12.8-fold (ciclosporin 100 mg dosed alone, 10 mg coadministered; dose normalized ciclosporin ratios are shown). Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 39%, 46% and 18%. The magnitude of interaction for ombitasvir was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir (Cmax decreased by 1%, AUC and Cmin increased 8% and 15%). The effect on ciclosporin is due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and the increase in paritaprevir exposures may be due to OATP/BCRP/P-gp inhibition by ciclosporin. When starting co-administration, give one fifth of the total daily dose of ciclosporin once daily. Monitor ciclosporin levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed. No dose adjustment is need for Viekirax.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Cidofovir	DB00369	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as cidofovir is mainly excreted in the urine via glomerular filtration and active secretion by OAT1/3.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cilazapril	DB01340	Coadministration has not been studied but cilazapril can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Cilazapril is metabolised by esterases to the active cilazaprilat which is excreted unchanged in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cilostazol	DB01166	Coadministration has not been studied. Cilostazol is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2. Coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir may increase concentrations of cilostazol leading to increased side effects. The product label for cilostazol suggests a dose reduction to 50 mg twice daily when given with CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19 inhibitors.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Cimetidine	DB00501	Coadministration has not been studied but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Cimetidine is an inhibitor of CYP isozymes but less potent than ritonavir. No effect of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir on cimetidine is expected since cimetidine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ciprofloxacin	DB00537	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ciprofloxacin is primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion via OAT3. It is also metabolized and partially cleared through the bile and intestine.	Coadministration did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 substrate, duloxetine. Other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are not expected to require dose adjustments.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Cisapride	DB00604	Coadministration is contraindicated. Cisapride is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase cisapride concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as cisapride, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Cisatracurium		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

Citalopram is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Escitalopram does not show any interaction with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Results from escitalopram can be extrapolated to citalopram. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clarithromycin	DB01211	Coadministration has not been studied. Clarithromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4/P-gp inhibition by ritonavir. In addition the exposure of paritaprevir may increase. Concomitant use is contraindicated. 	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied by is expected to increase concentrations of clarithromycin, and paritaprevir due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp by clarithromycin and ritonavir. Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as clarithromycin, is expected to increase paritaprevir plasma concentrations and must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Clavulanic acid		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug interaction is unlikely. Clavulanic acid is extensively metabolized (likely by a non-CYP mediated pathway) and excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration.  	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clevidipine	DB04920	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Clevidipine is rapidly metabolised by hydrolysis of the ester linkage and does not undergo CYP metabolism.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clindamycin	DB01190	Coadministration has not been studied. Clindamycin is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subject and use caution. A decrease in clindamycin dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clobazam	DB00349	Coadministration has not been studied. Clobazam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2C19 but its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Consider starting patient on current dose with close clinical monitoring for side effects associated with clobazam and decrease dose if necessary.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clobetasol (topical)		Coadministration has not been studied but topical clobetasol can be used with caution. Clobetasol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clobetasone (topical)	DB13158	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Following topical application to most areas of normal skin, only minimal amounts of the drug reach the dermis and subsequently the systemic circulation. Although clobetasone is a substrate of CYP3A4, a clinically significant effect is unlikely due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clomifene	DB00882	Coadministration has not been studied. Studies suggest that clomifene is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and UGTs and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clomipramine	DB01242	Coadministration has not been studied. Clomipramine is a substrate of CYPs 2C19, 3A4 and 1A2. Clomipramine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. Use the lowest possible dose of clomipramine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clonazepam	DB01068	Coadministration has not been studied. Clonazepam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir, resulting in the possibility of prolonged and/or increased pharmacologic effects of the benzodiazepine, including sedation and respiratory depression. Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended, a decrease in dose of clonazepam may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clonidine	DB00575	Coadministration has not been studied. Clonidine is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. At 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not inhibit CYP2D6, but theoretically, clonidine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. Use the lowest possible dose of clonidine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Clopidogrel	DB00758	Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite via CYPs 3A4, 2B6, 2C19 and 1A2. The effect on activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite is difficult to predict due to induction of CYP2C19 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir but is likely to decrease exposure of the active metabolite leading to non-responsiveness to clopidogrel . Coadministration with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4) decreased exposure of clopidogrel’s active metabolite by 22-29% and reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation by 22-33%. Non-responsiveness to clopidogrel has been reported in a HIV-positive patient with latent tuberculosis and treated with isoniazid and ritonavir-boosted darunavir. An alternative to clopidogrel should be considered. Note, the European SPC for clopidogrel contraindicates it use in severe hepatic impairment but the US Prescribing Information states no dose alteration.	A 64-year-old man presented with increasing shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain radiating to his left shoulder and neck. His home medications included darunavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, isoniazid, pyridoxine, clopidogrel, aspirin, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, valsartan, sertraline, tamsulosin and esomeprazole. Potential drug-drug interactions between isoniazid and clopidogrel, and ritonavir and clopidogrel were identified that could interfere with clopidogrel activation. Based on this, platelet function testing was completed and impaired clopidogrel response was seen on two platelet function tests. There was no genetic cause (i.e., CYP2C19 genotype) for the impaired clopidogrel response.A patient with HIV and tuberculosis with diminished clopidogrel response. Metzger NL, Momary KN.

OBV/PTV/r		Darbepoetin		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Darbepoetin is not hepatically metabolized and to date no clinically significant interactions have been published that would be of concern.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Darunavir	DB01264	Coadministration with darunavir is not recommended due to increased paritaprevir exposure. Coadministration with darunavir (800 mg once daily, given at the same time) decreased darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 1%, 8% and 26% but increased paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.09-, 1.94- and 1.85-fold. Of note, exposures of paritaprevir greater than this have been evaluated in phase 2 studies and were not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on safety. However, the clinical significance of the decrease in darunavir concentrations has not been evaluated. Darunavir/cobicistat should not be coadministered as ritonavir is part of the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir fixed dose combination.	Treatment with darunavir and Viekirax without dasabuvir is not recommended due to increased paritaprevir exposure. Coadministration with darunavir (800 mg once daily, given at the same time) decreased darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 1%, 8% and 26%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 2.09-, 1.94- and 1.85-fold. Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Dasatinib	DB01254	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of dasatinib and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Dasatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A4. There could be a marked increase in dasatinib exposure and it is also possible that ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir exposure may be increased. Coadministration is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Use with caution.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Delavirdine	DB00705	Coadministration has not been studied. Delavirdine is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir.

OBV/PTV/r		Desipramine	DB01151	Coadministration has not been studied but desipramine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no a priori dose alteration is required. Desipramine is a substrate of CYP2D6, and did not show interaction with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily). Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	Coadministration did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2  substrate, duloxetine. Other CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine) are  not expected to require dose adjustments.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Desloratidine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. The metabolism of desloratidine is poorly characterised and no clinically relevant interaction have been observed with other inhibitors of CYP enzymes.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Desmopressin	DB00035	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as desmopressin undergoes no significant metabolism.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Desogestrel	DB00304	Coadministration has not been studied. Desogestrel is a prodrug that requires activation to etonogestrel. Activation to etonogestrel is by CYP2C9 (and possible CYP2C19); the metabolism of etonogestrel is mediated by CYP3A4. Coadministration may increase the conversion to the active metabolite etonogestrel due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Although no dose adjustment is necessary for norethindrone (a progestogen) when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in the absence of an estrogen, it is unclear if this will apply to other orally administered progestogen only contraceptives.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Desvenlafaxine	DB06700	Coadministration has not been studied. Desvenlafaxine is a substrate of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and P-gp. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, increased exposure of venlafaxine and its metabolite by 20-141%. A similar magnitude of increase may be seen due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in dose may be needed. Note, a maximum dose of 50 mg is recommended in moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Dexamethasone	DB01234	Coadministration has not been studied. Dexamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Dexamethasone exposure (after IV and oral administration) increased by 3.3- to 3.7-fold when administered with itraconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. A similar magnitude of increase may be seen with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects for side effects due to adrenal suppression. A decrease in dexamethasone dose is recommended.

OBV/PTV/r		Droperidol	DB00450	Coadministration has not been studied but droperidol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alternation is required. However, droperidol has a QT risk and concentrations may alter due to induction of CYP1A2 and inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. If coadministration is deemed necessary, caution is warranted and clinical monitoring for increased side effects should be performed including ECG monitoring.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Drospirenone	DB01395	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance an interaction is unlikely. Drospirenone is metabolised mainly without involvement of CYP enzymes with little known involvement of transporters. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Dulaglutide	DB09045	Coadministration has not been studied. Dulaglutide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. It is advisable to separate administration if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Duloxetine	DB00476	Duloxetine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Duloxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. There was no interaction between duloxetine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Coadministration with duloxetine (60 mg single dose) increased paritaprevir Cmax by 7% and decreased AUC and Cmin by 4% and 7%. Note, duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment as concentrations may increase due to decreased clearance of duloxetine.	Coadministration with duloxetine (60 mg single dose) increased paritaprevir Cmax by 7% and decreased AUC and Cmin by 4% and 7%. The magnitude of interaction for duloxetine and ombitasvir was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir (duloxetine Cmax and AUC decreased by 21% and 25%; ombitasvir Cmax decreased by 2%, no change in AUC, Cmin increased by 1%). No dose adjustments are required when coadministered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Dutasteride	DB01126	Coadministration has not been studied. Dutasteride is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase in the presence of ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in dutasteride dose may be needed. Note, the European SPC (but not the US Prescribing Information) cautions against dutasteride use in mild to moderate hepatic impairment and contraindicates it in severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Echinacea		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and potent 3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Eculizumab	DB01257	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.

Alternative methods of contraception (e.g, progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) are recommended. Ethinyl estradiol-containing medications can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of HCV treatment.	Use of ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal products such as those contained in most combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings is contraindicated. Patients who are taking ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal products (i.e. most combined oral contraceptives or contraceptive vaginal rings) must switch to an alternative method of contraception (e.g., progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) prior to initiating Viekirax. Coadministration of Viekirax (with or without dasabuvir) and an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.035 mg) and norgestimate (0.25 mg) increased ethinylestradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 16%, 6% and 12%, respectively. The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of the metabolites of norgestimate increased by 2.26-, 2.54- and 2.93-fold for norgestrel, and by 2.01-, 2.60- and 3.11-fold for norelgestromin. Ombitasvir Cmax increased by 5%, AUC decreased by 3% and there was no change in Cmin. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 30%, 34% and13% respectively.

OBV/PTV/r		Ethosuximide	DB00593	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of ethosuximide due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir causing increased risk of CNS toxicity. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in ethosuximide dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Etoposide	DB00773	Coadministration has not been studied. Etoposide is partly metabolised by CYP3A4 to reactive catechol metabolites and partly metabolised by UGT1A1. Concentrations of etoposide may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir, increasing risk and severity of mucositis, myelosuppression and transaminitis. Use with caution.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Etoricoxib	DB01628	Coadministration has not been studied but etoricoxib can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Etoricoxib is a substrate of CYPs 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 1A2 and 2C19. The involvement of multiple P450s, and the low first pass effect, effectively minimizes the potential for significant drug interactions with potent CYP450 inhibitors such as ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Etravirine	DB06414	Coadministration has not been studied and is contraindicated. Decreased plasma concentrations of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir are expected due to CYP3A4 induction by etravirine.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers, such as etravirine, is expected to decrease ombitasvir and paritaprevir plasma concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Everolimus	DB01590	Coadministration has not been studied. Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Everolimus is not recommended with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in the absence of study data. Use alternative immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Exemestane	DB00990	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Exemestane is metabolised by CYP3A4 but coadministration with ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) showed no clinically significant effects and no effect is expected due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. No a priori dose adjustment is required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Exenatide	DB01276	Coadministration with exenatide has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as exenatide is eliminated via glomerular filtration. However, as exenatide slows gastric emptying it is advisable to take ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at least 1 hour before an exenatide injection.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ezetimibe	DB00973	Coadministration has not been studied. Ezetimibe is a substrate of UGT. Ezetimibe glucuronide is a substrate of OATP1B1 and this metabolite may increase due to OATP1B1 inhibition by paritaprevir. Start with the lowest possible dose and monitor. Note, use of ezetemibe is not recommended in moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Famotidine	DB00927	Coadministration has not been studied but famotidine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Famotidine is mainly renally excreted. Exposures of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir were not affected in the presence of omeprazole, an acid reducing agent. Hence, no interaction is expected with famotidine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Felodipine	DB01023	Coadministration has not been studied. Felodipine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Felodipine exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir resulting in the potential for hypotension and tachycardia (decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, swelling of lower extremities, etc.). If possible avoid concomitant use with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fenofibrate	DB01039	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as fenofibrate is metabolised by multiple enzyme pathways (esterases, UGT2B7 and UGT1A1). Note, fenofibrate is contraindicated in severe hepatic disease in its European SPC, and its US Prescribing Information contraindicates it in active liver disease.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fentanyl	DB00813	Coadministration has not been studied. Fentanyl is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects; a decrease in fentanyl dose should be considered.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fexofenadine	DB00950	Coadministration has not been studied. Use with caution. A dose decrease may be needed for fexofenadine when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Fexofenadine is a substrate of P-gp/OATP and is renally excreted. There was an increase in digoxin exposure of 36% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.  Since digoxin is a model P-gp substrate, an interaction of fexofenadine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir cannot be excluded due to involvement of OATP. 	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase fexofenadine concentrations due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by paritaprevir. Caution should be used when coadministered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Filgrastim	DB00099	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. CYP involvement has not been displayed with filgrastim and it is mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, such that the serum concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly with neutrophil recovery.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Finasteride	DB01216	Coadministration has not been studied. Finasteride is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subject.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fingolimod	DB08868	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Fingolimod is metabolised mainly by CYP4F2 and is unlikely to interact with substrates of CYP enzymes or the main transporter proteins.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fish oils		Coadministration has not been studied but fish oils can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Although cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the hydroxylation of omega-3 there is no human data to indicate any clinical significance.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flecainide	DB01195	Coadministration has not been studied. Flecainide is a substrate of CYP2D6. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6. However, flecainide is a narrow therapeutic index drug and and caution is advised.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flibanserin	DB04908	Coadministration has not been studied and is contraindicated. Flibanserin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir is expected to increase flibanserin concentrations which can cause severe hypotension and syncope.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flucloxacillin	DB00301	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Flucloxacillin is mainly eliminated renally, partly by glomerular filtration and partly by active secretion via OAT1. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fluconazole	DB00196	Coadministration has not been studied but fluconazole can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Fluconazole is mainly excreted in urine. Fluconazole exposure shows a clinically insignificant increase (12-15%) with ritonavir. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flucytosine	DB01099	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Flucytosine is metabolised to 5-fluorouracil which undergoes further metabolism by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fludarabine	DB01073	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed (non-CYP mediated) to 2F-ara-A, the principal metabolite, which is then eliminated renally.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fludrocortisone	DB00687	Coadministration has not been studied. Concomitant administration of ritonavir and corticosteroids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Fludrocortisone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Use alternative treatments.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fluindione		Coadministration has not been studied. Fluinidone is metabolised by CYP2C9 (major) and CYP1A2 (minor). Clinical studies showed no interaction between and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement. Any decrease in concentrations of fluindione due to induction of CYP1A2 by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is unlikely to be of clinical significance as this is a minor route of metabolism. However, case reports have described alterations in INR for patients receiving ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with warfarin or acenocoumarol, so close monitoring of INR is recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flunisolide	DB00180	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase flunisolide concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. An alternative to flunisolide should be used if available.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fluoxetine	DB00472	Coadministration has not been studied but fluoxetine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Fluoxetine is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Ritonavir exposures increased slightly (~19%) due to CYP2D6 inhibition by fluoxetine. Note, a lower or less frequent dose should be considered in cases of hepatic insufficiency.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flupentixol	DB00875	Coadministration has not been studied. Flupentixol is metabolised by sulfoxidation and dealkylation and is a substrate of UGT. Flupentixol exposure may increase with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. A decrease in dose should be considered. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fluphenazine	DB00623	Coadministration has not been studied. Fluphenazine is metabolised by and is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. However monitor for adverse events. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval could also be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flurazepam	DB00690	Coadministration has not been studied. Flurazepam is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of flurazepam may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing CNS depression and sedation. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in flurazepam dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Flurbiprofen	DB00712	Coadministration has not been studied but flurbiprofen can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alternation is required. Flurbiprofen is a substrate of CYP2C9 and multiple UGTs. There is no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement. The involvement of multiple UGTs means that no interaction is expected via this pathway.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fluticasone		Concomitant administration of ritonavir and glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Fluticasone is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of fluticasone may markedly increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing a decrease in plasma cortisol leading to Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with fluticasone. Use beclomethasone as an alternative.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of fluticasone due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Caution should be used with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoids metabolised with CYP3A can increase systemic exposures of the glucocorticoids, and cases of Cushing’s syndrome and subsequent adrenal suppression have been reported with ritonavir-containing regimens. Concomitant use, particularly long-term use, should only be initiated if the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Fluvastatin	DB01095	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Fluvastatin is a substrate of CYPs 2C9, 3A4, 2C8, and OATPs 1B1, 1B3 and BCRP. Exposure of fluvastatin may increase due to possible inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP by paritaprevir and ritonavir. A temporary suspension of fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. If statin treatment is required, switch to dose reduced pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Note, use of fluvastatin in active liver disease is contraindicated.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of fluvastatin due to inhibition of OATP1B1 and BCRP by paritaprevir. Coadministration is not recommended. A temporary suspension of fluvastatin is recommended for the duration of treatment with Viekirax. If statin treatment is required during the treatment period, a switch to dose reduced pravastatin or rosuvastatin is possible.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Fluvoxamine	DB00176	Coadministration has not been studied but fluvoxamine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Fluvoxamine is a substrate of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. It is unlikely that fluvoxamine will affect ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir exposure. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Folic acid	DB00158	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as folic acid undergoes deconjugation and reduction	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Formoterol	DB00983	Coadministration has not been studied. Formoterol is a substrate of UGT and CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 2C9 and 2A6. Due to involvement of multiple enzymes, inhibition of a single pathway may not affect formoterol exposures. However, use with caution and decrease formoterol dose, if clinically indicated. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Fosamprenavir	DB01319	Coadministration of fosamprenavir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is not recommended. Fosamprenavir is hydrolysed to amprenavir and then metabolised by CYP3A4. However amprenavir also inhibits CYP3A4. Exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and fosamprenavir may be altered.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Foscarnet	DB00529	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as foscarnet is mainly renally eliminated.  	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Frovatriptan	DB00998	Coadministration has not been studied. Frovatriptan is metabolised by CYP1A2 and exposure may be reduced with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to induction of CYP1A2 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Furosemide	DB00695	Coadministration with Viekirax alone has not been studied. Furosemide is a substrate of UGTs 1A1, 1A9 and 2B7 and is excreted in urine. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir with furosemide (20 mg single dose) increased furosemide Cmax and AUC by 42% and 8%. Caution is warranted. Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended and a decrease in furosemide dose of up to 50% may be required.	Coadministration with Viekirax alone has not been studied but a similar effect is expected as observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir with furosemide (20 mg single dose) increased furosemide Cmax and AUC by 42% and 8%. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 14%, 7% and 12%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC decreased by 7% and 8%, but Cmin increased by 26%. This is possibly due to UGT1A1 inhibition by paritaprevir, ombitasvir. Patients should be monitored for clinical effects; a decrease in furosemide dose of up to 50% may be required. No dose adjustment is needed for Viekirax.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.

No dose adjustment is recommended for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir or abacavir/lamuvudine during coadministration.Drug-drug interactions of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r plus dasabuvir with dolutegravir or abacavir plus lamivudine.Khatn A, Trinh R, Zhao W, et al. 16th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV and Hepatitis Therapy, Washington DC, May 2015, Abstract 57.
OBV/PTV/r		Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Coadministration has not been studied but lamivudine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Given the findings from the interaction study conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir, along with the known similar elimination pathway for lamivudine, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction is not expected.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Lamotrigine	DB00555	Lamotrigine is a substrate of UGT1A4. Atazanavir (a UGT1A1 inhibitor) does not affect lamotrigine glucuronidation, however, atazanavir /ritonavir decreases lamotrigine AUC by 32%. A similar interaction is possible with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor the subjects with adjustment of lamotrigine dose as appropriate.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Lanreotide	DB06791	Coadministration has not been studied. The limited information available indicate that somatostatin analogues, such as lanreotide, may increase concentrations of CYP450 substrates. Given that ritonavir is present in the current regimen the effect of lanreotide may be limited, however an interaction cannot be excluded. Monitor for side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Lansoprazole	DB00448	Coadministration has not been studied. Lansoprazole exposure may decrease when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Lansoprazole is a substrate of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Exposure of omeprazole, a model CYP2C19 substrate, decreased by 50% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, but exposures of the DAAs were not affected. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with other CYP2C19 substrates. Monitor the subject for lack of response and increase the dose of lansoprazole if clinically indicated.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to decrease concentrations of lansoprazole due to induction of CYP2C19 by ritonavir. If clinically indicated higher doses of lansoprazole may be needed.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Lapatinib	DB01259	Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended. Concentrations of lapatinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition by ritonavir. Lapatinib is an inhibitor of CYPs 3A4 and 2C8 but given the presence of ritonavir in this regimen it is unclear if there would be any additional increase in exposure of paritaprevir. Coadministration should be avoided if possible. If coadministration is unavoidable, a dose decrease of lapatinib will be required.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is a complete regimen. There are no data to support the coadministration with other DAAs.	Viekirax safety and efficacy have been established in combination with  dasabuvir and/or ribavirin. Co-administration of Viekirax with other  directly acting antivirals has not been studied and therefore cannot be  recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Lercanidipine	DB00528	Avoid concomitant use with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Lercanidipine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase with ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased plasma levels of the eutomer S-lercanidipine (AUC by 15-fold, Cmax by 8-fold). Consequently, the lercanidipine product label says that coprescription of lercanidipine with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, erythromycin, troleandomycin) should be avoided.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Letrozole	DB01006	Coadministration has not been studied but letrozole is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of letrozole may increase due to inhibition CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Caution is advised and a dose titration may be required.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Levothyroxine	DB00451	Coadministration has not been studied. Levothyroxine exposure may be increased due to UGT1A1 inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Levothyroxine is metabolised by sequential deiodination, glucuronidation and sulfation. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be carefully monitored in patients receiving levothyroxine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of levothyroxine due to inhibition of UGT1A1 by paritaprevir and ombitasvir. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may be required for levothyroxine.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Lidocaine (Lignocaine)	DB00281	Coadministration has not been studied. Lidocaine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of lidocaine may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir causing adverse effects (common adverse reactions are those from the central and peripheral nervous system). Therapeutic concentration monitoring should be done for lidocaine and a decrease in lidocaine dose maybe needed. Topical lidocaine can be used since there is minimal systemic absorption and adverse effects are averted.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Linaclotide	DB08890	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linaclotide is metabolised locally within the gastrointestinal tract and extensive studies have shown no CYP or transporter interactions occur.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Linagliptin	DB08882	Coadministration has not been studied. Linagliptin is a substrate and a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. However data with ritonavir (a potent 3A4/P-gp inhibitor) indicated that despite an increase in exposure of linagliptin, a clinically relevant interaction would not be expected due to the large safety window of linagliptin.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Linezolid	DB00601	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linezolid is not metabolised by CYP450 and is not known to affect any of the key enzymes.	(See Summary)

Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted entirely unchanged into the urine. Note, lisinopril exposure is increased in cirrhotic patients due to decreased clearance.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Lithium	DB01356	Coadministration has not been studied but lithium can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Lithium is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Lixisenatide	DB09265	Coadministration has not been studied. Lixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. However, delayed gastric emptying due to lixisenatide may reduce absorption of orally administered medicinal products. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Loperamide	DB00836	Coadministration has not been studied. Loperamide is substrate of P-gp and exposure may increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. There was an increase in exposure of the P-gp substrate digoxin and a similar change may occur with loperamide. Monitor the subjects; a reduction in loperamide dose may be needed. Note, use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment as no pharmacokinetic data are available and in such patients reduced first pass metabolism may result in a relative overdose leading to CNS toxicity.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Lopinavir	DB01601	Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily) is contraindicated due to increased paritaprevir exposure.  Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) increased paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 4.76-, 6.10- and 12.33-fold, respectively. This is likely due to the higher total dose of ritonavir (300 mg/day).	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) increased paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 4.76-, 6.10- and 12.33-fold, respectively. The magnitude of interaction for lopinavir and ombitasvir was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir (lopinavir Cmax and AUC decreased by 13% and 6%, Cmin increased by 15%; ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 14%, 17% AND 24%, respectively). The increase in paritaprevir exposures may be due to inhibition of CYP3A/efflux transporters by lopinavir and a higher dose of ritonavir. Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Loratadine	DB00455	Coadministration has not been studied. Loratadine is substrate of CYP3A4 and a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp and its exposure may increase with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to CYP3A4 inhibition.

Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at steady-state did not affect the plasma exposures of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) so it is unlikely that it will affect mefenamic acid. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir does not affect UGT1A9 and UGT2B7.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mefloquine	DB00358	Coadministration of mefloquine with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk due to QTc prolongation. Mefloquine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Co-administration of mefloquine (500 mg single oral dose) with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily for 10 days) in 8 healthy volunteers increased the mean Cmax and AUC of mefloquine by 64% and 79%, respectively. A similar interaction may occur with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Note, the European SPC for mefloquine (but not the US Prescribing Information) contraindicates the use of mefloquine in patients with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Melatonin	DB01065	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Melatonin is a substrate of CYP1A2 and concentrations may decrease due to induction of CYP1A2 by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. However, based on studies with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and duloxetine (a sensitive CYP1A2/CYP2D6 substrate), no a priori dose alteration is recommended. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Meloxicam	DB00814	Coadministration has not been studied. Meloxicam is a substrate of CYP2C9 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) and concentrations may be increased due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. There was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) so no interaction is expected due to CYP2C9 involvement.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mephedrone		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Mephedrone is metabolized mainly by CYP2D6. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose it does not appear to markedly inhibit CYP2D6. However, as dosing of recreational drugs can be variable, caution is advised. Ensure the patient is aware of signs/symptoms of mephedrone toxicity (i.e., agitation, tachycardia, hypertension).	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mercaptopurine	DB01033	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Mercaptopurine is converted into active thioguanine nucleotides by the enzyme xanthine oxidase and undergoes methylation by thiopurine methyltransferase to form S- methylated nucleotides, which are also cytotoxic. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Meropenem	DB00760	Coadministration has not been studied but meropenem can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Meropenem is mainly excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mesalazine	DB00244	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant drug interaction is unlikely as mesalazine largely acts locally in the gut and is acetylated there.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Metamizole	DB04817	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir exposures may decrease due to induction of CYP3A4 by metamizole.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Metformin	DB00331	Coadministration has not been studied. Metformin is mainly excreted in urine by active secretion via OCT-2 and MATE-1. Despite evidence that paritaprevir/ritonavir can inhibit MATE-1, preliminary unpublished data suggest there is no clinically significant interaction. Note, metformin is contraindicated with hepatic insufficiency, acute alcohol intoxication, and alcoholism.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Methadone	DB00333	Methadone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Methadone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and a substrate of P-gp. Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir alone has not be been studied, however, no interaction was observed between methadone and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir.	When coadministered with Viekirax alone, the magnitude of interaction was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir with methadone (20-120 mg once daily) increased R-methadone Cmax and AUC by 4% and 5%, but decreased Cmin by 6%. S-methadone Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 1%, 1% and 14%, respectively. (Dose normalised parameters reported for methadone.) There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir or paritaprevir based on cross-study comparison. No dose adjustment is necessary.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Methamphetamine	DB01577	Coadministration has not been studied. Methamphetamine is metabolised by CYP2D6.

OBV/PTV/r		Methylcellulose		Coadministration has not been studied. Methylcellulose is not absorbed and a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However, bulk laxatives such as oral methylcellulose lower the transit time through the gut and could affect the absorption of other drugs. It is advisable to separate administration if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Methyldopa	DB00968	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as methyldopa is mainly renally cleared. However methyldopa is contraindicated in active hepatitis and active cirrhosis in both the European and US product labels.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Methylergonovine		Coadministration has not been studied but methylergonovine is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been  studied but is expected to increase concentrations of ergot derivatives  due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are  highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma  levels are associated with serious events, such as ergot derivatives,  must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Methylphenidate	DB00422	Coadministration has not been studied but methylphenidate can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Methylphenidate is metabolised by de-esterification.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Methylprednisolone	DB00959	Coadministration has not been studied. Methylprednisolone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Methylprednisolone exposure (after oral/IV administration) increased by 2.6- to 3.9-fold with itraconazole, a CYP34 inhibitor. A similar interaction may be seen with ritonavir due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects for side effects due to adrenal suppression. A decrease in methylprednisolone dose is recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Metoclopramide	DB01233	Coadministration has not been studied but metoclopramide can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required.

Metoprolol is a substrate of CYP2D6. There was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and duloxetine, a CYP2D6/CYP1A2 substrate, and no interaction is expected with CYP2D6 substrates. Note, in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction a reduction in dosage may be necessary.	Coadministration did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2  substrate, duloxetine. Other CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. metoprolol) are  not expected to require dose adjustments.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Metronidazole	DB00916	Coadministration has not been studied but no dose adjustment is needed with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. The metabolism of metronidazole is not well described.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mexiletine	DB00379	Coadministration has not been studied but mexiletine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Mexiletine is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a substrate of CYP1A2. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Miconazole	DB01110	Coadministration has not been studied. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely after topical administration due to the limited systemic availability. When administered systemically miconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, but no additional inhibition of CYP3A4 is expected due to the presence of ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Midazolam (oral)	DB00683	Coadministration is contraindicated. Midazolam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase with ritonavir causing serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase midazolam concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as midazolam, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Midazolam (parenteral)	DB00683	Coadministration has not been studied. Midazolam is a substrate of CYP3A4 and concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with ritonavir may increase midazolam exposures. Coadministration should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase midazolam concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. If parenteral midazolam is co-administered, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustment should be considered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Mifepristone	DB00834	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase mifepristone concentrations due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor for increased side effects and for subsequent increase in toxicities. A decrease in mifepristone dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Milk thistle		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Drug interaction studies suggest that milk thistle has limited clinical impact on substrates of CYP3A, UGT, Pgp and OATP.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Milnacipran	DB04896	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as milnacipran undergoes minimal CYP450 related metabolism. Note, no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment, but caution should be exercised in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Milnacipran should ordinarily not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Minoxidil	DB00350	Coadministration has not been studied. Minoxidil is a substrate of UGTs (the specific UGTs have not been well described) and its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. The exposure of raltegravir (a UGT substrate) was increased by up to 2-fold with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir; a similar interaction is possible with other UGT substrates. In the absence of further data, monitor cardiac parameters and for increased side effects.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mirtazapine	DB00370	Coadministration has not been studied. Mirtazapine is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in mirtazapine dose may be needed.	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Moclobemide	DB01171	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Moclobemide is metabolised by multiple pathways, including CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Exposure of omeprazole, a model CYP2C19 substrate, decreased by 40-50% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, but exposures of each component of the DAA regimen were not affected. Ritonavir inhibits CYP2D6 at higher doses but at the 100 mg dose ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Due to multiple enzyme pathways involved in moclobemide metabolism, a clinically significant interaction is not expected. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Modafinil	DB00745	Coadministration of modafinil is not recommended with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Modafinil is a substrate of CYP3A4, an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, an inducer of CYPs 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 and a substrate of P-gp. Exposures of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir may decrease due to CYP3A4 induction by modafinil which may potentially decrease efficacy. Use alternative drugs.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Mometasone	DB00764	Coadministration has not been studied. Mometasone is substrate of CYP3A4. Mometasone plasma concentrations increased in some subjects on co-administration of ketoconazole. Since mometasone plasma levels appear to increase and plasma cortisol levels decrease with ketoconazole, caution should be exercised on coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. A decrease in dose of mometasone is recommended. Monitor the subject closely for any adrenal suppression effects. Beclometasone can be used as an alternative.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Montelukast	DB00471	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Montelukast is a substrate of CYP2C8.	(See Summary)

Naloxegol is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations are expected to increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased naloxegol AUC by ~13-fold; a similar increase would be expected with ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Naloxone	DB01183	Naloxone can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Coadministration with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir alone has not been studied, but coadministration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) increased naloxone Cmax and AUC by 18% and 28%. There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir based on cross-study comparison.	Coadministration with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) increased buprenorphine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.18-, 2.07- and 3.12-fold, respectively; values for norbuprenorphine increased by 2.07-, 1.84- and 2.10-fold, respectively. Naloxone Cmax and AUC increased by 18% and 28%. (Dose normalised parameters reported for buprenorphine and naloxone.) The increases were due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and UGT inhibition by paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir. There was no change in exposure of ombitasvir, paritaprevir or dasabuvir based on cross-study comparison. No dose adjustment is necessary.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Exviera Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.Coadministration with buprenorphine (4-24 mg once daily) and naloxone (1-6 mg once daily) was studied in 10 subjects.

OBV/PTV/r		Neostigmine	DB01400	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Neostigmine metabolism has not been well described but limited data suggest metabolism occurs via hydrolysis by cholinesterase with up to 50% of a dose being excreted unchanged in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Nevirapine	DB00238	Coadministration is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied and the effect is difficult to predict since there could be a two-way interaction. Nevirapine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and therefore exposure could increase due to inhibition by ritonavir. In addition, nevirapine can induce some CYP enzymes with expected decreases in ombitasvir and paritaprevir exposures.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers, such as nevirapine, is expected to decrease ombitasvir and paritaprevir plasma concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.

OBV/PTV/r		Norethisterone (Norethindrone)	DB00717	Norethindrone as a PROGESTIN ONLY can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Norethindrone is metabolised by glucuronidation and sulfation. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir administered with dasabuvir did not cause a clinically significant change in norethindrone exposure (Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 17%, 9% and 15%, respectively). However it is CONTRAINDICATED when given as a combined oral contraceptive with ethinylestradiol due to an increase in ALT.	Coadministration with Viekirax alone has not been studied but a similar effect is expected as observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir and a progestin only contraceptive containing norethindrone (0.35 mg) decreased norethindrone Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 17%, 9% and 15%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax was unchanged and AUC and Cmin decreased by 1% and 3%. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 24%, 23% and 43%, respectively.

OBV/PTV/r		Ondansetron	DB00904	Coadministration has not been studied but ondansetron can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Ondansetron is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Exposure of ondansetron was not affected by aprepitant, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As multiple enzymes are involved in the metabolism of ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination. Note, ondansetron clearance is significantly reduced and half-life significantly increased in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; in such patients a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded and parenteral or oral administration is recommended.

OBV/PTV/r		Oxaliplatin	DB00526	Coadministration has not been studied. Oxaliplatin undergoes non enzymatic biotransformation and is eliminated renally, via OCT2 and MATE2-K and, to a lesser extent, MATE-1. Since paritaprevir/ritonavir can inhibit MATE-1, monitoring of the patient is recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Oxamniquine	DB01096	Coadministration has not been studied but oxamniquine can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Limited data suggest that oxamniquine is likely to be a substrate of CYP2D6 but ritonavir at the 100 mg dose does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Oxazepam	DB00842	Coadministration has not been studied. Oxazepam is a substrate of UGT and its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A reduction in oxazepam dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Oxcarbazepine	DB00776	Coadministration has not been studied and alternative drugs should be used. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir exposures may decrease due to induction of CYP3A4 by oxcarbazepine. 	(See Summary)

OBV/PTV/r		Oxycodone	DB00497	Coadministration has not been studied. Oxycodone is a substrate of CYP3A4. Ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased oxymorphone AUC by 3-fold and reduced noroxycodone and noroxymorphone AUCs by 80%. Inhibition of CYP3A4 resulted in metabolism by the CYP2D6 pathway. A similar effect could be anticipated with ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in oxycodone dose may be needed. Note, use of oxycodone in patients with moderate to severe hepatic failure is contraindicated in the European SPC but not in the US Prescribing Information.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Paliperidone	DB01267	Coadministration has not been studied. Paliperidone is a substrate of P-gp and concentrations may increase due to P-gp inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.

Pantoprazole is a substrate of CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and is also metabolised by sulfotranseferases. Exposure of omeprazole, a model CYP2C19 substrate, decreased by 50% when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, but exposure of the DAA was not affected. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with other CYP2C19 substrates. Use higher doses of pantoprazole, if clinically indicated.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Paracetamol		Coadministration has not been studied but paracetamol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required.

In the absence of further data, monitor for increased side effects. Although perampanel is an inducer of CYP3A4, a clinically significant effect on the components of the DAA regimen is unlikely in the presence of ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Perazine		Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended unless there is clear benefit due to the potential increase in perazine due to ritonavir CYP3A4 inhibition. Cardiac conduction abnormalities have been associated with perazine and ECG monitoring is recommended in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Pericyazine		Coadministration has not been studied. The metabolism of pericyazine has not been well characterised but it is likely to involve CYP2D6. At 100 mg dose ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6 but in the absence of data with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, monitor for increased side effects of pericyazine. Monitoring is recommended as cardiac conduction abnormalities, including QT prolongation may be seen with pericyazine.	(See Summary)

Pirfenidone is metabolised by CYP1A2 (70-80%) with minor contributions from CYPs 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Although ritonavir induces CYP1A2, due to the involvement of multiple metabolic pathways a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Piroxicam	DB00554	Coadministration has not been studied but piroxicam can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Piroxicam is a substrate of CYP2C9 and is also metabolised by hydrolysis. There was no interaction between ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, so no interaction is expected with piroxicam.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Pitavastatin	DB08860	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Pitavastatin is a substrate for several transporters which may be inhibited by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. A temporary suspension of pitavastatin is recommended for the duration of treatment. If a statin is required, switch to dose reduced pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Note, use of pitavastatin in active liver disease is contraindicated in its US Prescribing Information.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase concentrations of pravastatin due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by paritaprevir. Coadministration is not recommended.

OBV/PTV/r		Raltegravir	DB06817	Raltegravir can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Raltegravir is a substrate of UGT1A1. Raltegravir Cmax and AUC increased by 22% and 20%, respectively, in presence of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir was comparable to the historic data. The increase in raltegravir exposure is not clinically relevant for safety. Hence, no dose adjustment is necessary.	Coadministration with raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 22%, 20% and 13%, respectively. The increase in raltegravir exposures may be due to UGT1A1 inhibition by paritaprevir and ombitasvir.

OBV/PTV/r		Ranolazine	DB00243	Coadministration of ranolazine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated due to the increase in exposure and potential for serious adverse effects. A marked interaction can be anticipated with ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rasagiline	DB01367	Coadministration has not been studied. Rasagiline is a substrate of CYP1A2 (major) and UGT (minor) and its exposure may decrease due to CYP1A2 induction by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor the subjects and consider a dose modification if necessary.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Repaglinide	DB00912	Coadministration has not been studied. Repaglinide is metabolised mainly by CYP2C8 with CYP3A4 playing a minor role and is a substrate of OATP1B1. Repaglinide exposure increased by 1.2-fold and 2.4-fold with atorvastatin and ciclosporin (both inhibitors of OATP1B1) and a similar interaction is expected with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to OATP1B1 inhibition by paritaprevir. A dose reduction is recommended.	Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase repaglinide concentrations due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by paritaprevir. Caution should be used and dose decrease may be needed for repaglinide when administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Retigabine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However, there is the risk of QT prolongation with both drugs and ECG monitoring is recommended if coadministered.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Retinol (Vitamin A)		Coadministration has not been studied. Retinol is substrate of UGTs and its exposure may increase due to UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. This is unlikely to be of clinical importance, unless high doses of retinol supplementation are given long term. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ribavirin	DB00811	Ribavirin can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir based on a specific patient population. Refer to the product label for full prescribing details.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)	DB00140	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as riboflavin does not undergo CYP metabolism and is primarily eliminated in urine.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rifabutin	DB00615	Coadministration has not been studied. An increase in the exposure of rifabutin and its metabolite are expected due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least three-quarters of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (e.g., 150 mg every other day or three times a week). Further dosage reduction may be necessary.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rifampicin	DB01045	Coadministration is contraindicated. Rifampicin is an inducer of CYP3A4 and may decrease exposures of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir leading to loss of virologic response. Rifampicin exposure may increase resulting in increased likelihood of toxicity.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to decrease concentrations of ombitasvir and paritaprevir due to induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin. Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers, such as rifampicin, is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect and must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Rifapentine	DB01201	Coadministration has not been studied. Rifapentine is an inducer of CYP3A4 and P-gp and may decrease the exposure of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor subjects for anticipated response.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rifaximin	DB01220	Coadministration has not been studied. Rifaximin is an inducer of CYP3A4 and a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. Rifamixin did not show a clinically significant interaction with midazolam, a model CYP3A4 substrate, but exposure was about 10-, 13-and 20-fold higher in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy volunteers. Monitor subjects for an appropriate and expected response to rifamixin and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Note, caution should be exercised when rifamixin is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rilmenidine		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as rilmenidine is not metabolised to any great extent.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rilpivirine	DB08864	Coadministration of rilpivirine and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir has not been studied and is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Rilpivirine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure increased significantly when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir. Coadministration should only be considered in patients without known QT prolongation and without other QT prolongation medications. If treatment is warranted, use cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring. 	Rilpivirine exposure is substantially increased (~3-fold) when rilpivirine is given in combination, with a consequent potential for QT-prolongation. Co-administration with rilpivirine once daily should only be considered in patients without known QT-prolongation, and without other QT-prolongation co-medications. Rilpivirine should be used cautiously, in the setting of repeated ECG monitoring. Coadministration with Viekirax alone has not been studied but a similar effect is expected as observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. Coadministration of Viekirax + dasabuvir and rilpivirine (25 mg once daily administered in the morning, with food) increased rilpivirine Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 2.55-, 3.25- and 3.62-fold, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 11%, 9% and 5%, respectively. Paritaprevir Cmax and AUC increased by 30% and 23%, but Cmin decreased by 5%. Dasabuvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 18%, 17% and 10%, respectively. (Rilpivirine was also administered in the evening with food and at night 4 hours after dinner in other two arms in the study. The effect on rilpivirine exposures was similar to that observed when rilpivirine was administered in the morning with food). If an HIV protease inhibitor is added (atazanavir, darunavir), rilpivirine exposure may increase even further and is therefore not recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Rimantadine	DB00478	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Rimantadine undergoes complex liver metabolism being both hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Although ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir can affect some CYP and UGT pathways, due to multiple enzyme pathways involved in the metabolism of rimantadine, a clinically significant interaction is not expected.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Risedronate	DB00884	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. There is no evidence of systemic metabolism of risedronate; 60% of the dose is distributed to bone and the remainder is excreted in urine. However the absorption of risedronate may be affected by food, drinks (other than plain water) or other medicinal products. Risendronate should be taken at least 2 hours before and at least 2 hours after any food, medicinal product or drink.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Risperidone	DB00734	Coadministration has not been studied. Risperidone is a substrate and inhibitor of CYPs 2D6, 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 3 A4. At 100 mg dose, ritonavir does not markedly inhibit CYP2D6. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased the AUC of risperidone and its metabolite by 66% and 48%, respectively. An interaction of similar magnitude is expected with ritonavir. Monitor the subjects. A decrease in risperidone dose may be needed.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ritonavir	DB00503	Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is a complete regimen containing ritonavir. Coadministration with additional ritonavir is not recommended.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rituximab	DB00073	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is not expected as rituximab is removed by opsonization via the reticularendothelial system. 	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rivaroxaban	DB06228	Coadministration has not been studied. Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. Ritonavir increased rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax by 150% and 60%, respectively. Similar increases in pharmacodynamic effects (i.e., factor Xa inhibition and PT prolongation) were also observed. Significant increases in rivaroxaban exposure may increase bleeding risk. Rivaroxaban label recommends avoiding use with ritonavir. Use alternative if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rizatriptan	DB00953	Coadministration has not been studied but rizatriptan can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Rizatriptan is metabolised by MAO.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Ropinirole	DB00268	Coadministration has not been studied. Ropinirole is a substrate of CYP1A2. Exposure of ropinirole may be decreased with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to induction of CYP1A2 by ritonavir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rosiglitazone	DB00412	Coadministration has not been studied. Rosiglitazone is metabolized by CYP2C8 and concentrations may be increased due to inhibition of CYP2C8 by ritonavir and ombitasvir.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Rosuvastatin	DB01098	Coadministration with rosuvastatin (5 mg once daily) increased rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC by 2.61- and 1.33-fold, but Cmin decreased by 35% due to OATP1B inhibition by paritaprevir and BCRP inhibition by paritaprevir and ritonavir. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 40%, 22% and 6%, respectively. The maximum rosuvastatin dose should be 10 mg once daily with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Note, rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease and should be used with caution in patients who consume excessive quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease.	Coadministration with rosuvastatin (5 mg once daily) increased rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC by 2.61- and 1.33-fold, but Cmin decreased by 35% due to OATP1B inhibition by paritaprevir and BCRP inhibition by paritaprevir and ritonavir. Paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 40%, 22% and 6%, respectively. The magnitude of interaction for ombitasvir was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir (Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 8%, 11% and 12%, respectively). If rosuvastatin treatment is required during treatment with Viekirax without dasabuvir, the maximum daily dose of rosuvastatin should be 10 mg. No dose adjustment is needed for Viekirax.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Rufinamide	DB06201	Coadministration has not been studied but would not be recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Rufinamide is a moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and may decrease exposures of components of the DAA regimen which may lead to loss of virologic response. It is difficult to predict the overall effect of CYP3A4 induction on DAA exposure in the presence of ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Salbutamol	DB01001	Coadministration has not been studied but salbutamol can be administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and no dose alteration is required. Salbutamol is metabolised by sulfotransferases.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Salmeterol	DB00938	Coadministration is contraindicated. Salmeterol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. This may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration has not been studied but is expected to increase salmeterol concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events, such as salmeterol, must not be co-administered.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Saquinavir	DB01232	Coadministration of saquinavir with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is contraindicated. Saquinavir is metabolised by CYP3A4 but may also inhibit CYP3A4. Exposure of paritaprevir is expected to be markedly increased.	Concomitant use is contraindicated. Coadministration is expected to  increase concentrations of paritaprevir due to inhibition  of CYP3A4 by saquinavir. Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.

OBV/PTV/r		Serenoa repens		Co-administration has not been studied.  Serenoa repens has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro but given the presence of ritonavir in this regimen it is unclear if there would be any additional increase in exposure of paritaprevir.  Coadministration should be avoided if possible.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Sertraline	DB01104	Coadministration has not been studied. Sertraline is a substrate of CYPs 2B6 (major), 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 and 2D6, and a possible substrate of UGT2B7. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir has not shown an interaction with a CYP2B6 substrate (methadone). However, sertraline exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Use with caution. Monitor the subjects. A dose reduction of sertraline may be required. Note, use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment when a lower or less frequent dose may be required. Sertraline should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Sevelamer	DB00658	Coadministration has not been studied. Sevelamer is not absorbed from the GI tract and may potentially affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products.

OBV/PTV/r		Tacrolimus	DB00864	Tacrolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir increased tacrolimus Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 4-fold, 86-fold and 25-fold, respectively. Therapeutic monitoring is required. Administer tacrolimus 0.5 mg once a week when coadministered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Monitor tacrolimus levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed. 	Coadministration increased tacrolimus Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 4.27-, 85.8- and 24.6-fold (tacrolimus 2 mg dosed alone, 0.5 mg coadministered; dose normalized tacrolimus ratios are shown). The magnitude of interaction for ombitasvir and paritaprevir was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir (ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 7%, 6% and 6%; paritaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 43%, 34% and 27%, respectively). The effect on tacrolimus is due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. When starting co-administration, administer 0.5 mg tacrolimus once every week. Monitor tacrolimus levels and adjust dose and/or dosing frequency as needed. No dose adjustment is need for Viekirax.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.
OBV/PTV/r		Tadalafil (erectile dysfunction)	DB00820	Coadministration has not been studied. Tadalafil is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir.

OBV/PTV/r		Tamoxifen	DB00675	Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYP3A4 by ritonavir may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Tamsulosin	DB00706	Coadministration has not been studied. Tamsulosin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Exposure of tamsulosin increases (2.2- to 2.8-fold) with ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor.

OBV/PTV/r		Warfarin	DB00682	Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and warfarin can be coadministered with close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR). Warfarin is a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir at steady-state did not affect the plasma exposures of S-warfarin or R-warfarin. However, a case report describes a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) becoming subtherapeutic two weeks after starting ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with ribavirin. Close monitoring is recommended as dose modifications may be necessary in some patients.	Coadministration with warfarin (5 mg single dose) and Viekirax + dasabuvir increased R-warfarin Cmax by 5%, but decreased AUC and Cmin by 12% and 6%; the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of S-warfarin decreased by 4%, 12% and 5%, respectively. Ombitasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 6%, 4% and 2%. Paritaprevir Cmax and Cmin decreased by 2% and 4%, but AUC increased by 7%. The magnitude of interaction with Viekirax alone was similar to that observed with Viekirax + dasabuvir. While no dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin, appropriate monitoring of international normalised ratio (INR) is recommended.Viekirax Summary of Product Characteristics, AbbVie Ltd, January 2015.A case report describes a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) becoming subtherapeutic two weeks after starting ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir with ribavirin, Eleven weeks into therapy and following a 125% total increase in the weekly warfarin dose, therapeutic INR was achieved. Thirteen days after DAA therapy was completed and discontinued, the patient's INR became critically supratherapeutic.

OBV/PTV/r		Zopiclone	DB01198	Coadministration has not been studied. Zopiclone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and its exposure increased by 80% with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. A greater magnitude of interaction is expected with ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Coadministration of eszopiclone (its structural analogue) with ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased eszopiclone exposure by 2.2-fold. Monitor the subjects. Start with a lowest possible dose of zopiclone. Note, elimination of zopiclone may be reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction and a lower dose of zopiclone nightly is recommended for these patients. Zopiclone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.	(See Summary)
OBV/PTV/r		Zuclopentixol		Coadministration has not been studied. Zuclopenthixol exposure may increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir and UGT inhibition by ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Zuclopenthixol is a substrate of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and UGT, but the relative contribution of each metabolic pathway is unknown. Monitor the subjects. Start with a lowest possible dose of zuclopenthixol.

Peg-IFN alfa		Abacavir	DB01048	Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing HIV therapy and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anaemia.	Patients receiving PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a)/COPEGUS (ribavirin) and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a), COPEGUS (ribavirin) or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment- associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.Cirrhotic  chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients’ clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score ≥6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management.

Case reports of two patients with chronic hepatitis C who developed or suffered an exacerbation of sarcoidosis when treated with IFN-a2a, ribavirin and amantadine.	Two patients with chronic hepatitis C who developed or suffered an exacerbation of sarcoidosis while under treatment with IFN-a2a, ribavirin and amantadine are reported. Patient 1: symptoms appeared after week 4 and treatment was withdrawn at month 9 due to severe weight loss, marked dyspnea, muscular weakness, dryness of mouth and facial paralysis. Stage III pulmonary sarcoidosis and polyneuropathy were confirmed. Patient 2: presented with a previous diagnosis of granulomatous hepatitis with chronic active hepatitis C and chronic dermatitis. The treatment exacerbated a cutaneous sarcoidosis. Furthermore, hiliar adenopathies consistent with stage I sarcoidosis became evident. Sarcoidosis responded to corticosteroids, but elevated transaminases and hepatitis C viraemia resisted. The combination of amantadine with ribavirin and IFN can develop or exacerbate subclinical sarcoidosis. A synergistic effect of these three drugs is suggested.Sarcoidosis in two patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon, ribavirin and amantadine.

Peg-IFN alfa		Azathioprine	DB00993	Pancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported to occur within 3-7 weeks after the coadministration of peginterferon and ribavirin with azathioprine. The use of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine should be avoided.	Pancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. The use of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine should be avoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done during concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with these drugs should be stopped.Pegasys Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2010.Pancytopenia (marked decreases in RBCs, neutrophils and platelets) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine.

Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.Cirrhotic  chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients’ clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score ≥6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities.

Peg-IFN alfa		Methadone	DB00333	Coadministration of peginterferon alfa-2a (180 micrograms sc once weekly for 4 weeks) to HCV patients stable on methadone maintenance therapy was associated with 10-15% higher mean methadone levels than at baseline. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of methadone toxicity. For patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.	In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 HCV patients concomitantly receiving methadone maintenance therapy (median dose 95 mg; range 30 mg to 150 mg), treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) 180 micrograms sc once weekly for 4 weeks was associated with mean methadone levels that were 10% to 15% higher than at baseline. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; nonetheless, patients should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of methadone toxicity. Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.Pegasys Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, July 2010.In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of ViraferonPeg (peginterferon alfa-2b) subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103-128 %). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression. Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.ViraferonPeg Summary of product Characteristics, Schering-Plough Ltd, May 2010.The pharmacokinetics of concomitant administration of methadone and PEGASYS were evaluated in 24 PEGASYS naive chronic hepatitis C patients (15 male, 9 female) who received 180 µg PEGASYS subcutaneously weekly. All patients were on stable methadone maintenance therapy (median dose 95 mg, range 30 mg to 150 mg) prior to receiving PEGASYS. Mean methadone PK parameters were 10% to 15% higher after 4 weeks of PEGASYS treatment as compared to baseline. Methadone did not significantly alter the PK of PEGASYS as compared to a PK study of 6 chronic hepatitis C patients not receiving methadone. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of methadone toxicity.Pegasys US Prescribing Information, Genentech Inc, June 2010.The pharmacokinetics of concomitant administration of methadone and PegIntron were evaluated in 18 PegIntron-naïve chronic hepatitis C subjects receiving 1.5 mcg/kg PegIntron subcutaneously weekly. All subjects were on stable methadone maintenance therapy receiving >40 mg/day prior to initiating PegIntron. Mean methadone AUC was approximately 16% higher after 4 weeks of PegIntron treatment as compared to baseline. In 2 subjects, methadone AUC was approximately double after 4 weeks of PegIntron treatment as compared to baseline. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of increased narcotic effect.PegIntron US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, January 2010.

Telaprevir must not be administered as monotherapy and must only be prescribed in combination with both peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Telaprevir must not be administered as monotherapy and must only be prescribed with both peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir alone (750 mg three times daily, n=8) or peginterferon alfa-2a alone (180 µg per week, n=4) or the combination (n=8) was studied in HCV-infected subjects.  Telaprevir Cmax on the first day of dosing did not differ significantly when given alone (3695 ng/ml) or with peginterferon (3391 ng/ml).  At steady state (day 14), there was a trend towards higher telaprevir exposure in the combination group, but this did not reach statistical significance.  Due to study limitation (small sample size, parallel design) no definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effect of telaprevir on peginterferon.  Peginterferon concentrations in both groups were within the range given in the product label.Antiviral activity of telaprevir (VX-950) and peginterferon alfa-2b in patients with hepatitis C.  Forestier N, et al.  Hepatol, 2007, 46(3): 640-648.
Peg-IFN alfa		Telbivudine	DB01265	Coadministration with pegylated or standard interferon alfa is contraindicated. The pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose coadministration with pegylated interferon alfa-2a. No definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon due to high interindividual variability. A clinical trial investigating coadministration indicates that the combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known. The combination of telbivudine with any interferon alfa-containing product is contraindicated. 	The steady-state pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose administration in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a. No definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon due to high interindividual variability of pegylated interferon alfa-2a concentrations. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known. The combination of telbivudine with any interferon alfa-containing product is contraindicated.Sebivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, January 2011. Combination of telbivudine with pegylated interferon alfa-2a is contraindicated because of increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Drug-drug interaction studies show that pegylated interferon alfa- 2a does not alter telbivudine pharmacokinetics. No definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon alfa-2a due to the high inter-individual variability of pegylated interferon alfa-2a concentrations. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported with telbivudine alone or in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and other interferons. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination may be associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy occurrence and severity, in comparison to telbivudine or pegylated interferon alfa-2a alone. The safety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with pegylated interferons or other interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated.Tyzeka US Prescribing Information, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, December 2011. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration for the treatment of HBV, indicates that the combination is associated with an increased risk for developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known; thus, co-treatment with telbivudine and other interferons (pegylated or standard) may also entail an excess risk. Moreover, the benefit of the combination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established. Therefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is contraindicated.Pegasys Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, December 2011.Peripheral neuropathy has been reported when alpha interferons were given in combination with telbivudine. In one clinical trial, an increased risk and severity of peripheral neuropathy was observed with the combination use of telbivudine and pegylated interferon-alfa 2a as compared to telbivudine alone.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Abacavir	DB01048	Caution should be exercised when abacavir and ribavirin are coadministered. As abacavir and ribavirin share the same phosphorylation pathways a possible intracellular interaction has been postulated which could decrease ribavirin intracellular phosphorylated metabolites and result in a reduced likelihood of SVR. While some initial data suggested that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing regimens may be at risk of lower response to ribavirin therapy, this has not been confirmed in more recent studies. In addition a well-designed study to evaluate the effects of abacavir on intracellular ribavirin triphosphate and plasma ribavirin concentrations failed to show any significant effect.	Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis. Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro. This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir). Conflicting findings are reported in literature on co-administration between abacavir and ribavirin. Some data suggest that HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving abacavir-containing ART may be at risk of a lower response rate to pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy. Caution should be exercised when both medicines are co-administered.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Schering-Plough Ltd, September 2010.Ribavirin steady state Cmin was prospectively determined in pharmacokinetic substudy on 124 HIV-HCV coinfected patients receiving ribavirin plus Peg-IFN from the ANRS CO-13 HEPAVIH cohort. Of these patients, 22% received abacavir. The overall median ribavirin Cmin was 1.6  mg/L with no statistical difference between abacavir users and non-users. There was no difference in the proportion of abacavir users versus non-users achieving RVR (respectively 59% versus 50%, p = 0.40) or EVR (72% versus 73%, p = 0.94), or in the HCV-RNA decline at week 4 or 12. The SVR rate was 45% for abacavir users and 24% for abacavir non-users, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.059). Ribavirin and abacavir drug interaction in HIV-HCV coinfected patients: fact or fiction? Solas C, Pambrun E, Winnock M, et al. AIDS, 2012, Epub ahead of print. To determine if use of abacavir, and other antiretrovirals were associated with reduced response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, a cohort study was performed among antiretroviral-treated HIV/HCV patients initiating PEG-interferon plus ribavirin (n=212). 74 patients (35%) received abacavir. No differences were observed between abacavir users and non-users in early virologic response or sustained virologic response. No association was found between other antiretrovirals and lack of early or sustained response.The influence of abacavir and other antiretroviral agents on virologic response to hepatitis C virus therapy among antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected patients. Amorosa V, Slim J, Mounzer K et al. Antivir Ther. 2010 ; 15: 91–99. In order to assess the influence of antiretrovirals on hepatitis C treatment with ribavirin and peginterferon, the outcomes of 493 HIV positive patients receiving first line treatment for hepatitis C were retrospectively analysed. Among the factors associated with lack of sustained virological response according to multivariate analysis, a trend was observed with abacavir use, which was significant in patients with lower ribavirin plasma levels (<2.3 µg/ml). Use of abacavir may interfere with anti-HCV efficacy of peginterferon and ribavirin treatment. As both ribavirin and abacavir are guanosine analogues, an inhibitory competition between both agents may explain this observation.Low response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with abacavir. Vispo E, Barreiro P, Pineda JA  Antivir Ther. 2008;13:429-37.In multivariate analysis of data from the French HC02-Ribavic Study, concomitant treatment with abacavir and pegIFN + ribavirin was associated with an adjusted 4.9 fold increase in the risk of non-response to anti-HCV therapy. Ribavirin can affect intracellular NRTI anabolite levels by inhibiting the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase and it is intriguing to speculate that alterations of carbovir triphosphate levels (the active metabolite of abacavir) may be at least part of the reason for the observed effect. Early virologic failure in HIV-coinfected hepatitis C patients treated with the peginterferon-ribavirin combination: does abacavir play a role? Bani-Sadr F, et al.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Amantadine	DB00915	Two patients with chronic hepatitis C who developed or suffered an exacerbation of sarcoidosis while under treatment with IFN-alfa2a, ribavirin and amantadine. The combination of amantadine with ribavirin and IFN can develop or exacerbate subclinical sarcoidosis. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy. 	Two patients with chronic hepatitis C who developed or suffered an exacerbation of sarcoidosis while under treatment with IFN-α2a, ribavirin and amantadine are reported. Patient 1: symptoms appeared after week 4 and treatment was withdrawn at month 9 due to severe weight loss, marked dyspnea, muscular weakness, dryness of mouth and facial paralysis. Stage III pulmonary sarcoidosis and polyneuropathy were confirmed. Patient 2: presented with a previous diagnosis of granulomatous hepatitis with chronic active hepatitis C and chronic dermatitis. The treatment exacerbated a cutaneous sarcoidosis. Furthermore, hiliar adenopathies consistent with stage I sarcoidosis became evident. Sarcoidosis responded to corticosteroids, but elevated transaminases and hepatitis C viraemia resisted. The combination of amantadine with ribavirin and IFN can develop or exacerbate subclinical sarcoidosis.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Atazanavir	DB01072	A substantial proportion of patients receiving atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir experienced significant hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice following initiation of ribavirin and pegylated interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C. Ribavirin-related haemolysis resulted in increased production of bilirubin, the normal clearance of which by UGT1A1 was inhibited by atazanavir. Coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat has not been studied. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy.	Serum bilirubin was monitored in 22 HIV+ patients on atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir who started hepatitis C treatment (pegylated interferon weekly and ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day). Increased production of bilirubin occurred due to ribavirin-related haemolysis. The normal clearance of bilirubin by UGT1A1 was inhibited by atazanavir resulting in hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice. The proportion of patients with hyperbilirubinaemia grade 3-4 increased from 9% to 45% after the start of hepatitis C treatment. None of the patients in the control group (n=30) developed hyperbilirubinaemia grade 3-4.

Atropine metabolism has not been well described but is thought to be by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites and up to 50% is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely; however, by possibly delaying gastric emptying, atropine may alter the absorption of ribavirin but the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Azathioprine	DB00993	Ribavirin may interfere with azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate, which has been associated with myelotoxicity. The use of pegylated alfa interferons and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine should be avoided. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy. 	Ribavirin, by having an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, may interfere with azathioprine metabolism possibly leading to an accumulation of 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate, which has been associated with myelotoxicity. Pancytopenia and bone marrow suppression have been reported within 3 to 7 weeks after the administration of a peginterferon and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine. This myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. The use of pegylated alpha interferons and ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine should be avoided. In individual cases where the benefit of administering ribavirin concomitantly with azathioprine warrants the potential risk, it is recommended that close hematologic monitoring be done during concomitant azathioprine use to identify signs of myelotoxicity, at which time treatment with these medicines should be stopped.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Schering-Plough Ltd, September 2010.Pancytopenia (marked decreases in RBCs, neutrophils and platelets) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon/ribavirin and azathioprine. In this limited number of patients (n=8), myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone. Peginterferon, ribavirin, and azathioprine should be discontinued for pancytopenia, and pegylated interferon/ribavirin should not be re-introduced with concomitant azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate, which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.The medical records of eight patients who developed severe pancytopenia following concomitant use of azathioprine and ribavirin were retrospectively reviewed, in order to investigate the interaction of ribavirin with azathioprine metabolism, which can lead to myelotoxicity. Bone marrow suppression reached nadir after a mean interval of 4.6 -1.6 weeks following HCV therapy initiation in seven patients. No haematological toxicity occurred after the reintroduction of peginterferon plus ribarivin or azathioprine alone in eight patients. Ribavirin has an inhibitory effect on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and may interfere with azathioprine metabolism, leading to accumulation of 6-MMPR, including 6 methylthioinosine monophosphate, which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and /or anaemia) in patients treated with azathioprine, possibly by inhibiting de novo synthesis of purines. The benefit ⁄ risk ratio favours avoidance of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors in purine analogue-treated patients with normal thiopurine methyltransferase activity.Interaction of ribavirin with azathioprine metabolism potentially induces myelosuppression.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Didanosine	DB00900	Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate) is increased in vitro when didanosine is co-administered with ribavirin. Reports of fatal hepatic failure as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactataemia/ lactic acidosis have been reported with use of ribavirin. Co-administration of Copegus and didanosine is not recommended. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy. 	Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may also be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and possibly death if treated with Copegus in combination with interferons. Baseline variables in co-infected cirrhotic patients that may be associated with hepatic decompensation include: increased serum bilirubin, decreased haemoglobin, increased alkaline phosphatase or decreased platelet count, and treatment with didanosine (ddI). Caution should therefore be exercised when adding peginterferon alfa-2a and Copegus to HAART.  Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate) is increased in vitro when didanosine is co-administered with ribavirin. Reports of fatal hepatic failure as well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactataemia/ lactic acidosis have been reported with use of ribavirin. Co-administration of Copegus and didanosine is not recommended.Copegus Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, April 2010.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Schering-Plough Ltd, September 2010.In vitro, didanosine or its active metabolite (dideoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate) is increased when didanosine is co-administered with ribavirin, which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Emtricitabine	DB00879	Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing HIV therapy and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anaemia.	Patients receiving PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a)/COPEGUS (ribavirin) and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a), COPEGUS (ribavirin) or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment- associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.Cirrhotic  chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients’ clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score ≥6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Raltegravir	DB06817	Coadministration of ribavirin (800 mg single dose) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) to healthy subjects had no significant effect on raltegravir exposure or on ribavirin AUC and Cmin, but decreased ribavirin Cmax by 21% and increased Tmax by 39%.  When ribavirin and raltegravir were coadministered to HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects, raltegravir and ribavirin plasma concentrations were similar to those previously described. Median raltegravir trough concentration in the presence of ribavirin was 0.051 mg/L compared to 0.071 mg/L prior to ribavirin. The combination appears safe and well tolerated and the alteration in ribavirin pharmacokinetics is unlikely to be of clinical significance.	The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin (800 mg single dose) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily for 5 days) were investigated in 14 HIV-negative subjects when administered alone or in combination.  Ribavirin had no statistically significant effect on raltegravir pharmacokinetics; however, ribavirin Cmax was significantly reduced by 21% and Tmax significantly increased by 39% in the presence of raltegravir.  There was no difference in ribavirin AUC or Cmin and no clinically significant safety concerns were reported.  The alteration of the pharmacokinetic profile of ribavirin in the presence of raltegravir is unlikely to be of clinical significance.The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of raltegravir and ribavirin, when dosed separately and together in healthy volunteers.  Ashby J, et al. 10th International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, Glasgow, 2010, Abstract O315.A retrospective analysis was performed on data from 11 HIV/HCV coinfected patients who received raltegravir (400 mg twice daily, initiated prior to HCV therapy) and ribavirin (initiated at 400-1600 mg daily).  HIV viral load remained undetectable in all patients during anti-HCV therapy.  HCV early virological response was achieved in 8 patients and no patient experienced major hepatic toxicity.  Median ribavirin trough concentration at steady state was 1.98 mg/L (ribavirin dose 100-2000 mg/day).  Median raltegravir trough concentration in the presence of ribavirin was 0.051 mg/L compared to 0.071 mg/L prior to ribavirin.  The combination of raltegravir and ribavirin/peg-interferon appears to be safe, with raltegravir and ribavirin plasma concentrations similar to those previously described.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Stavudine	DB00649	In clinical studies, patients concurrently treated with stavudine and interferon therapy with or without ribavirin, the incidence of pancreatitis and/or lactic acidosis was 3% (12/398). Co-administration of Copegus and stavudine should be avoided to limit the risk of overlapping mitochondrial toxicity. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy. 	In study NR15961, patients concurrently treated with stavudine and interferon therapy with or without ribavirin, the incidence of pancreatitis and/or lactic acidosis was 3% (12/398). Co-administration of Copegus and stavudine should be avoided to limit the risk of overlapping mitochondrial toxicity. Ribavirin was shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine and stavudine. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. However, these in vitro findings raise the possibility that concurrent use of Copegus with either zidovudine or stavudine might lead to increased HIV plasma viraemia. It is recommended that plasma HIV RNA levels be closely monitored in patients treated with Copegus concurrently with either of these two agents. If HIV RNA levels increase, the use of Copegus concomitantly with reverse transcriptase inhibitors must be reviewed.Copegus Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, April 2010.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Schering-Plough Ltd, September 2010.In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of stavudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and stavudine (n=10) were co-administered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HCV/HIV coinfected patients.Copegus US prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.Ribavirin may antagonize the cell culture antiviral activity of stavudine against HIV. Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of stavudine, which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and stavudine (n=10) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen to HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Therefore, concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution.Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Tenofovir-DF		In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of tenofovir and ribavirin does not result in substantial changes to the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug. However, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing HIV therapy and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anaemia. 	In a 36-day, open-label, fixed-sequence interaction study to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin, healthy volunteers (n=23) received a 600-mg once-daily oral dose of ribavirin on days 1 and 22 and 300-mg once-daily oral doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on days 17 through 24. Pharmacokinetics of ribavirin was not altered by its coadministration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Tenofovir pharmacokinetics after ribavirin coadministration was similar to that observed in previous studies.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Warfarin	DB00682	A case study describes a patient receiving combination treatment with interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. The dose of warfarin had to be increased by approximately 40% to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy. 	A 61-year-old white man received combination treatment with interferon and ribavirin during 1 year for chronic hepatitis C. He was on permanent anticoagulant therapy with warfarin after a previous heart valve replacement. The dose of warfarin had to be increased by approximately 40% to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation. A rechallenge with ribavirin alone demonstrated that the inhibition of warfarin could be reproduced. During 4 weeks after starting or discontinuing treatment with ribavirin, prothrombin time may be affected in patients receiving warfarin for anticoagulation. It seems prudent to monitor warfarin therapy more frequently during those periods.Inhibition of warfarin activity by ribavirin. Schulman S. Ann Pharmacother 2002;36:72-74.

Ribavirin	DB00811	Zidovudine	DB00495	Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV. The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia. Due to ribavirin's long half life, any potential for interactions may persist for up to 2 months (5 half lives) after cessation of ribavirin therapy. 	Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia. Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination ART regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine induced anaemia.  Ribavirin was shown in vitro to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine and stavudine. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. However, these in vitro findings raise the possibility that concurrent use of Copegus with either zidovudine or stavudine might lead to increased HIV plasma viraemia. It is recommended that plasma HIV RNA levels be closely monitored in patients treated with Copegus concurrently with either of these two agents. If HIV RNA levels increase, the use of Copegus concomitantly with reverse transcriptase inhibitors must be reviewed.Copegus Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, April 2010.Rebetol Summary of Product Characteristics, Schering-Plough Ltd, September 2010.In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and zidovudine (n=6) were co-administered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HCV/HIV coinfected patients. In Study NR15961, patients who were administered zidovudine in combination with PEGASYS/COPEGUS developed severe neutropenia (ANC <500) and severe anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL) more frequently than similar patients not receiving zidovudine (neutropenia 15% vs 9%) (anemia 5% vs 1%).Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.Ribavirin may antagonize the cell culture antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV. Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of zidovudine, which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity. However, in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppress) interaction was observed when ribavirin and zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen to HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. Therefore, concomitant use of ribavirin with either of these drugs should be used with caution.Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.A study investigated the effect of a range of drugs on intracellular phosphorylation of ZDV by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Molt 4 cells, and U937 cells in vitro.

Simeprevir	DB06290	Tamoxifen	DB00675	Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as mild inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by simeprevir may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4.	(See Summary)

Telaprevir	DB05521	Albendazole	DB00518	Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and the flavine-containing monooxygenase system are involved in the formation of the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide. Telaprevir could potentially reduce albendazole sulfoxidation and thus lower the clinical effect of albendazole. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Albiglutide	DB09043	Coadministration has not been studied. Albiglutide delays gastric emptying and therefore may affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. The clinical effect of this is unknown.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Alendronic acid	DB00630	Co-administration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Alfentanil	DB00802	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase alfentanil concentrations as it is a substrate of CYP3A4.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Amiodarone	DB01118	Note the difference between the European SPC (contraindicated) and the US Prescribing Information (caution): the charts reflect the more cautious option. Coadministration is contraindicated in the European SPC, but the US Prescribing Information suggests use with caution and recommends clinical monitoring. Coadministration has not been studied, but both amiodarone and telaprevir are inhibitors of CYP3A4, therefore, both concentrations may increase. As telaprevir is a more potent inhibitor, increased concentrations of amiodarone may be more likely and produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events. 	Telaprevir must not be administered concurrently with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as cardiac arrhythmia (i.e., amiodarone).

Although clobetasone is a substrate of CYP3A4, a clinically significant effect is unlikely due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clomifene	DB00882	Coadministration has not been studied. Studies suggest clomiphene is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and UGTs and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clomipramine	DB01242	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as clomipramine is metabolised mainly by CYP2D6.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clonazepam	DB01068	Coadministration has not been studied, but may increase clonazepam concentrations as clonazepam has been shown to be a CYP3A4 substrate in human and animal studies.	Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam. Klonopin Prescribing Information, Genentech USA Inc, August 2010.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clonidine	DB00575	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as ~70% administered clonidine is excreted in the urine, mainly in form of the unchanged parent drug (40-60% of the dose).	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clopidogrel	DB00758	Coadministration has not been studied. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolites via CYPs 2C19, 3A4, 2B6, and 1A2. Telaprevir may decrease concentrations of the active metabolite and an alternative could be considered. Note, the European SPC for clopidogrel contraindicates clopidogrel in severe hepatic impairment but the US Prescribing Information states no dose alteration.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clorazepate	DB00628	Coadministration has not been studied. Clorazepate is rapidly converted to nordiazepam which is then metabolized to oxazepam by CYP3A4. Telaprevir could potentially increase nordiazepam exposure via inhibition of CYP3A4 which could prolong sedation. Careful monitoring of patients with regard to sedative effects is warranted and a decrease in the dose of clorazepate may be required.  Any dose adjustment made during telaprevir treatment should be re-evaluated after administration of telaprevir is completed.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Cloxacillin	DB01147	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Cloxacillin is metabolised to a limited extent and the unchanged drug and metabolites are excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Clozapine	DB00363	Coadministration of substances known to inhibit the activity of some cytochrome P450 isozymes may increase the levels of clozapine. This is more important for CYP 1A2 inhibitors and pharmacokinetic interactions with CYP 3A4 inhibitors are unlikely, although some have been reported. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Cobicistat (with ATV or DRV)	DB09065	Coadministration of telaprevir with cobicistat and atazanavir or darunavir has not been studied. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg three times daily) and elvitegravir/cobicistat (150/150 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF) did not alter telaprevir pharmacokinetics. Cobicistat AUC and Cmax were unchanged whereas Cmin increased by 232%. The European SPC for cobicistat advises that no dose adjustment is required when cobicistat is coadministered with telaprevir, but the US Prescribing Information for cobicistat states that coadministration is not recommended.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Cocaine	DB00907	Coadministration has not been studied. Cocaine is metabolized by several pathways, with metabolism to norcocaine by CYP3A4 being less than 10% of the overall metabolic clearance. Telaprevir could potentially increase concentrations of the parent compound. The clinical relevance is unknown as cocaine is metabolized by other non-CYP mediated pathways. Ensure the patient is aware of signs/symptoms of cocaine toxicity.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Codeine	DB00318	Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data suggest that telaprevir may increase codeine concentrations via inhibition of CYP3A4, although CYP2D6 is also involved in the metabolic process.	Since the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes play a major role in the metabolism of codeine, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 activity may cause decreased clearance of codeine which could lead to an increase in codeine plasma concentrations. If coadministration with codeine sulfate is necessary, caution is advised when initiating therapy with, currently taking, or discontinuing CYP450 inhibitors. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. Codeine Sulphate Prescribing Information, Roxane, June 2011.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Colchicine	DB01394	Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with telaprevir, due to the risk of colchicine toxicity arising from inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp by telaprevir. A limited colchicine treatment course at a reduced colchicine dose or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function. See telaprevir US Prescribing Information for details of dosing in the treatment and prophylaxis of gout flares and the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever. 	Coadministration may increase colchicine concentrations.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with telaprevir, due to the risk of colchicine toxicity. In patients with normal renal and hepatic function, an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended, or only a limited colchicine treatment course at a reduced colchicine dose should be used.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine with telaprevir, due to the risk of colchicine toxicity. A reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function. Co-administration of colchicine for treatment of gout flares in patients on telaprevir: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) for 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later; not to be repeated before 3 days. Co-administration of colchicine for prophylaxis of gout flares in patients on telaprevir: if the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day; if the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day. Co-administration of colchicine for treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in patients on telaprevir: maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Colestyramine		Coadministration has not been studied. Colestyramine may delay or reduce the absorption of drugs. Administration of other drugs should be at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after colestyramine.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Conivaptan	DB00872	Coadministration has not been studied. Conivaptan is metabolized by CYP3A4 and ccoadministration is contraindicated with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as telaprevir. Coadministration with ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased conivaptan AUC by 11-fold. Treatment with CYP3A substrates may be initiated no sooner than 1 week after the infusion of conivaptan has been completed.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Cyclobenzaprine	DB00924	Coadministration has not been studied. Cyclobenzaprine undergoes a complex metabolic process involving glucuronidation and several CYP enzymes including CYPs 3A4 and 1A2. Coadministration may increase cyclobenzaprine concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir, though the clinical significance of this is unknown. Monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Cytisine	DB09028	Coadministration has not been studied and the pharmacokinetics of cytisine in both human and animal studies have been very poorly described. There are no significant reports of drug interactions or CYP involvement and based on its structural similarity to nicotine and varenicline, a clinically significant interaction seems unlikely. In the absence of data, patients should be clinically monitored.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Dabigatran		Coadministration may increase dabigatran concentrations through inhibition of P-gp. No effect on telaprevir concentrations is expected. Caution is warranted. Laboratory and clinical monitoring is recommended. The European SPC and US Prescribing Information for dabigatran recommend reducing the dose to 150 mg once daily in the presence of strong P-gp inhibtors, such as telaprevir. 	Coadministration may increase dabigatran concentrations through an effect on P-gp transport in the gut. Caution is warranted. Laboratory and clinical monitoring is recommended. No effect on telaprevir concentrations is expected. Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Daclatasvir	DB09102	Coadministration of daclatasvir (20 mg once daily) and twice daily telaprevir (500 mg twice daily) increased daclatasvir AUC and Cmax by 132% and 46%, with no clinically relevant effect on telaprevir AUC (6% decrease) or Cmax (1% increase). When the same dose was administered with three times daily telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) daclatasvir AUC and Cmax increased by 115% and 22%, with no clinically relevant effect on telaprevir AUC (1% decrease) or Cmax (2% increase). The dose of daclatasvir should be reduced to 30 mg once daily when coadministered with telaprevir.	Coadministration of daclatasvir (20 mg once daily) and telaprevir (500 mg twice daily) increased daclatasvir AUC and Cmax by 132% and 46% with no clinically relevant effect on telaprevir AUC (6% decrease) or Cmax (1% increase). When the same dose was administered with telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) daclatasvir AUC and Cmax increased by 115% and 22% with no clinically relevant effect on telaprevir AUC (1% decrease) or Cmax (2% increase).

Telaprevir	DB05521	Dasatinib	DB01254	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of both dasatinib and telaprevir.  Dasatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4.  Telaprevir is predicted to cause a marked increase in dasatinib exposure.  It is also possible that dasatinib could increase the exposure of telaprevir.  Coadministration is not recommended, but if unavoidable, use with extreme caution.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Delavirdine	DB00705	Coadministration has not been studied and the effect is difficult to predict from the currently available drug-drug interaction studies. Delavirdine and telaprevir are both inhibitors of CYP3A4 and coadministration may increase concentrations of telaprevir and/or delavirdine.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Desipramine	DB01151	Coadministration has not been studied. Desipramine is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6.  Based on the known metabolic pathway of desipramine, telaprevir is not expected to alter desipramine concentrations. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Desloratidine		Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. The metabolism of desloratidine has been poorly characterised but no clinically relevant interactions have been observed with other inhibitors of CYP enzymes.	The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other medicinal products cannot be fully excluded. Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Dihydroartemisinin		Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydroartemisinin may induce 3A4 and theoretically may decrease telaprevir concentrations. Monitor therapeutic effect. A clinically significant effect on dihydroartemisinin is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Dihydrocodeine	DB01551	Coadministration has not been studied. Dihydrocodeine is converted to dihydromorphine (active metabolite) via CYP2D6, to dihydrocodeine-6-glucuronide via UGT2B7 (major pathway) and to nordihydrocodeine via CYP3A4. The analgesic effect appears to be primarily due to the parent compound. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir may increase the analgesic effects of dihydrocodeine. Monitor the analgesic effect and for signs of opiate toxicity.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Dihydroergotamine	DB00320	Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for acute ergot toxicity.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Doxazosin	DB00590	Coadministration has not been studied. Doxazosin is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and telaprevir is likely to increase doxazosin concentrations which may cause hypotension. Use with caution. Note, the European SPC does not recommend doxazosin in severe hepatic impairment; the US Prescribing Information has a caution for use in hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Doxepin	DB01142	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Doxepin is metabolised to nordoxepin by CYP2CA9 and CYP2D6 and telaprevir is not involved in this pathway. Note, the European and US product labels for doxepin advise caution and monitoring in patients with hepatic impairment as a dosage reduction may be required.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Doxorubicin	DB00997	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase doxorubicin concentrations due to inhibition of P-gp by telaprevir. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Monitor closely for cytotoxic side effects.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Doxycycline	DB00254	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Doxycycline is mainly excreted in the urine and faeces as unchanged active substance.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Dronedarone	DB04855	Coadministration has not been studied. Dronedarone is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as telaprevir, is contraindicated in its product labels due to increased risk of QT prolongation.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Droperidol	DB00450	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended due to the increase risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Concentrations of droperidol are likely to increase due to CYP3A4 inhibition. If coadministration is deemed necessary, caution is warranted and clinical monitoring for increased side effects should be performed including ECG monitoring due to increased risk of QT prolongation.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Drospirenone	DB01395	Although drospirenone is metabolised mainly without involvement of CYP enzymes, a 2-fold increase in drospirenone AUC was observed with boceprevir. Since the mechanism has not been elucidated, a clinically significant interaction with telaprevir is possible.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Dulaglutide	DB09045	Coadministration has not been studied. Dulaglutide delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. It is advisable to separate administration if possible.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Duloxetine	DB00476	Coadministration has not been studied. Duloxetine is metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Based on the known metabolic pathways telaprevir are not expected to alter duloxetine concentrations. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely. Note, duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment as concentrations may increase due to decreased clearance of duloxetine.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Dutasteride	DB01126	Co-administration has not been studied. Dutasteride is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and coadministration may increase dutasteride concentrations. Monitor for increased side effects such as impotence, decreased libido and dizziness. The European SPC for dutasteride suggests switching to 48 hourly dosing if side effects become problematic. Note, the European SPC (but not the US Prescribing Information) cautions against dutasteride use in mild to moderate hepatic impairment and contraindicates it in severe hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Echinacea		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Studies using a cocktail of probe drugs showed Echinacea inhibited CYP1A2 and intestinal CYP3A activity, and induced hepatic CYP3A activity. However, coadministration of Echinacea and potent 3A4 inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir showed no clinically significant effect of Echinacea on lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations (most likely due to the potent CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir). Based on these data, Echinacea is unlikely to alter telaprevir exposure.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Eculizumab	DB01257	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Eculizumab contains only naturally occurring amino acids and has no known active metabolites. Human antibodies are predominately catabolized by lysosomal enzymes to small peptides and amino acids. No drug interactions have been described to date.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Edoxaban	DB09075	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase edoxaban concentrations due to inhibition of P-gp by telaprevir. The European product label for edoxaban states to consider a dose reduction of edoxaban from 60 mg to 30mg with strong P-gp inhibitors, however, the US product label recommends no dose modification.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Efavirenz	DB00625	Coadministration decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 9%, 26% and 47%. Efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 16%, 7% and 2%. The European SPC recommends that if co-administered, telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 h should be used. 	Coadministration of efavirenz and telaprevir (1125 mg every 8 h) decreased telaprevir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 18%, 14% and 25%, respectively and relative to 750 mg every 8 h. Efavirenz AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 18%, 24% and 10%.  If co-administered, telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 h should be used.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) to 21 subjects decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 9%, 26% and 47%.  Efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 16%, 7% and 2%. Coadministration of efavirenz/tenofovir (600/300 mg once daily) and telaprevir (1125 mg every 8 hours, n=15) decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 14%, 18% and 25%, respectively (compared to telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone); efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 24%, 18% and 10%. Coadministration of efavirenz/tenofovir (600/300 mg once daily) and telaprevir (1500 mg every 12 hours, n=15) decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 3%, 20% and 48%, respectively (compared to telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone); efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 20%, 15% and 11%.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. The effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of telaprevir was studied in 28 healthy subjects. Coadministration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) decreased telaprevir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 26%, 9% and 47%, respectively.The effect of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on the pharmacokinetics of telaprevir. Garg V, et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of Hepatitis Therapy, June 2011, abstract PK_13. In a study, 20 subjects started telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) followed by efavirenz/tenofovir (600/300 mg once daily for 7 days) after a washout. Subsequently, they received telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 hours and efavirenz/tenofovir 600/300 mg once daily for 7 days or telaprevir 1500 mg every 12 hours and efavirenz/tenofovir 600/300 mg once daily for 7 days in a randomized order without a washout. When compared to data from telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone, the AUC and Cmin of telaprevir 1125 mg every 8 h decreased by 18% and 25%, but the AUC and Cmin of telaprevir 1500 every 12 h decreased by 20% and 48%. Efavirenz AUC and Cmin decreased by 18% and 10% with telaprevir 1125 mg every 8h, and decreased by 15% and 11% with telaprevir 1500 every 12 h. Tenofovir AUC and Cmin increased by 10% and 17% with telaprevir 1125 mg every 8h, and increased by 10% and 6% with telaprevir 1500 every 12 h.Pharmacokinetic interactions between ARV agents and the investigational HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir in healthy volunteers.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Elbasvir/Grazoprevir		Elbasvir/grazoprevir (with or without ribavirin) is a complete DAA regimen. There are no data to support the coadministration with other HCV Protease inhibitors.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Eletriptan	DB00216	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Concentrations of eletriptan are likely to increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. The US Prescribing Information for eletriptan contraindicates its use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and the European SPC advises that it should not be used with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Eltrombopag	DB06210	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.  Eltrombopag is metabolised by cleavage, conjugation and to a minor extent (~20%) by CYP1A2 and 2C8. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Elvitegravir/cobi/FTC/TAF		Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Coadministration with telaprevir has the potential to adversely affect the intracellular activation and clinical antiviral efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide.	Co-administration with telaprevir has the potential to adversely affect the intracellular activation and clinical antiviral efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide, therefore co-administration of Genvoya and telaprevir is not recommended. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg three times daily) and elvitegravir/cobicistat (150/150 mg once daily, with emtricitabine and tenofovir-DF) had no effect on telaprevir AUC, Cmax or Cmin. There was no change in elvitegravir AUC and Cmax, but Cmin increased by 29%. There was change in cobicistat AUC and Cmax, but Cmin increased by 232%.Genvoya Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, November 2015.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Elvitegravir/cobi/FTC/TDF		No dose adjustment is necessary when elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF (Stribild) is coadministered with telaprevir. Coadministration of Stribild and telaprevir (750 mg three times daily) was studied in 16 HIV/HCV-negative subjects. Telaprevir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 13%, 6% and 15%. Elvitegravir AUC and Cmax decreased by 16% and 21%, but Cmin increased by 32%. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 6%, 3% and 8%, respectively, whereas emtricitabine AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 5%, 3% and 8%, respectively. The AUC of cobicistat increased by 2% but Cmax decreased by 13% and Cmin increased by 3.4-fold.	Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg three times daily) and elvitegravir/cobicistat (150/150 mg once daily) had no effect on the AUC, Cmin or Cmax of telaprevir. Elvitegravir AUC and Cmax were unaltered and Cmin increased by 29%. Cobicistat AUC and Cmax were unaltered, but Cmin increased by 132%. No dose adjustment is required when Stribild is co-administered with telaprevir.Stribild Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, May 2015. The pharmacokinetics and drug interaction potential between Stribild and telaprevir (750 mg three times daily) were investigated in HIV/HCV-negative subjects (n=16). Telaprevir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 13%, 6% and 15%, respectively, but exposure was within the protocol defined lack of interaction boundary. Following coadministration, tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 6%, 3% and 8%, respectively, whereas emtricitabine AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 5%, 3% and 8%, respectively. Elvitegravir AUC and Cmax decreased by 16% and 21%, respectively, but were within the no-effect boundary. Elvitegravir Cmin, the parameter best associated with antiviral activity, increased by 32% and was >10-fold above the protein-binding adjusted IC95 (45 ng/mL). The AUC of cobicistat increased by 2% but Cmax decreased by 13% and Cmin increased by 3.4-fold. The authors describe these changes as not clinically meaningful and no dose adjustment is necessary when Stribild is coadministered with telaprevir.Lack of clinically relevant drug interactions between elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and telaprevir. Custodio JM, Guo S, Lawson E, et al. 53rd Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy (ICAAC), 2013, Abstract A-1576.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Empagliflozin	DB09038	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Empagliflozin is metabolised by UGTs and is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OAT3, and OATP1B1/1B3. Although telaprevir is an inhibitor of P-gp, data with verapamil (also a P-gp inhibitor) suggest a clinically relevant effect on empagliflozin is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Emtricitabine	DB00879	Coadministration had not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance an interaction appears unlikely. Emtricitabine undergoes limited metabolism and is excreted via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. There is low potential for CYP 450 involvement.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Emtricitabine/TAF		Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Coadministration with telaprevir has the potential to adversely affect the intracellular activation and clinical antiviral efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide.	The co-administration of Descovy is not recommended with telaprevir. Interaction not studied with either of the components of Descovy. Co-administration with telaprevir has the potential to adversely affect the intracellular activation and clinical antiviral efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide, therefore co-administration of Descovy and telapreivr is not recommended.Descovy Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, April 2016.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Enalapril	DB00584	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Enalapril is a prodrug hydrolysed in the liver to enalaprilat. Of note, enalapril can also cause a rash more common at onset of treatment.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Enoxaparin	DB01225	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Enoxaparin does not undergo cytochrome metabolism but is desulphated and depolymerised in the liver, and is excreted predominantly renally.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Entecavir	DB00442	Coadministration has not been studied but would appear unlikely as entecavir is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form and is not a substrate of any CYP isoenzymes.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Eplerenone	DB00700	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Concentrations of eplerenone may increase significantly due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir increasing the risks of associated side effects and toxicities. The concomitant use of eplerenone with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated in its European and US product labels.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Epoetin alfa		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Eprosartan	DB00876	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as eprosartan is largely excreted in bile and urine as unchanged drug.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ergometrine (ergonovine)		Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for acute ergot toxicity. 	Telaprevir must not be administered concurrently with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as peripheral vasospasm or ischemia (i.e., ergonovine).Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir and ergonovine is contraindicated due to the potential for acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm or ischemia.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ergotamine	DB00696	Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for acute ergot toxicity. 	Telaprevir must not be administered concurrently with active substances that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events such as peripheral vasospasm or ischemia (i.e., ergotamine).Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir and ergotamine is contraindicated due to the potential for acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm or ischemia.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Erlotinib	DB00530	Coadministration has not been studied. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and coadministration could potentially increase erlotinib concentrations. Coadministration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided, but if this is not possible, use with caution. Close monitoring for erlotinib mediated toxicity is necessary and a dose reduction may be required for erlotinib.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ertapenem	DB00303	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ertapenem is mainly eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration and none of the six major CYP isoforms have been shown to play a role in its metabolism.	Interactions caused by inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated clearance or CYP-mediated clearance of medicinal products are unlikely. In-vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the six major CYP isoforms: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4.Invanz Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, December 2011.In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoforms: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. In vitro studies indicate that ertapenem does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin or vinblastine and that ertapenem is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport.Invanz Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, February 2012.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Erythromycin	DB00199	Coadministration may increase telaprevir and erythromycin concentrations as both telaprevir and erythromycin inhibit CYP3A4. QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported with erythromycin. In the event that co-administration is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended. 	Coadministration may increase the concentrations of telaprevir and erythromycin. QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported with erythromycin. Caution is recommended when prescribing telaprevir concurrently with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and which are CYP3A substrates such as erythromycin. Telaprevir may increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal product and this may result in an increased risk of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. In the event that co-administration of such medicinal products with telaprevir is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Concentrations of both telaprevir and erythromycin may be increased during co-administration. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended when co-administered with telaprevir. QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported with erythromycin.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Escitalopram	DB01175	Coadministration had no significant effect on telaprevir concentrations, but decreased escitalopram Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 30%, 35% and 42%, respectively; the mechanism behind this is unknown. Escitalopram has a wide therapeutic index, but doses may need to be adjusted.	Coadministration had no significant effect on telaprevir concentration but decreased escitalopram AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 35%, 30% and 42%, respectively.  Clinical relevance unknown.  Doses may need to be increased when combined with telaprevir.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Concentrations of escitalopram were decreased when co-administered with telaprevir. Coadministration of escitalopram (10 mg once daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) to 13 subjects had no effect on telaprevir Cmax, but decreased AUC by 7% and Cmin by 9%.  The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of escitalopram decreased by 30%, 35% and 42%, respectively. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as escitalopram have a wide therapeutic index, but doses may need to be adjusted when combined with telaprevir.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) and escitalopram (10 mg once daily) was studied in an open label, randomised, cross-over study in 13 HCV-negative subjects. Escitalopram did not influence the pharmacokinetics of telaprevir; Cmax was unchanged, AUC and Cmin decreased by 7% and 9%, respectively. Exposure to escitalopram decreased by ~35%; Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 30%, 35% and 42%, respectively.The pharmacokinetic interaction between escitalopram and the investigational HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir. van Heeswijk R, et al. 5th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of Hepatitis Therapy, Boston 2010, Abstract 12.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Eslicarbazepine		Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended as eslicarbazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4 and coadministration may result in sub clinical telaprevir concentrations. In addition, eslicarbazepine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Esomeprazole	DB00736	Coadministration had no clinically significant effect on telaprevir concentrations.	Coadministration had no significant effect on telaprevir concentrations (2% decrease in AUC, 5% decrease in Cmax).  Proton pump inhibitors can be used without dose modification.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of esomeprazole (40 mg once daily) and telaprevir (750 mg single dose) to 24 subjects decreased telaprevir Cmax by 5% and AUC by 2%. Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg single dose) and esomeprazole (40 mg once daily) was studied in an open label, randomised, cross-over study in 23 HCV-negative subjects.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Ethinylestradiol		Coadministration decreased ethinylestradiol Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 26%, 28% and 33%, respectively but had no significant effect on telaprevir concentrations. Hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and for up to two weeks following cessation of telaprevir. Female patients of childbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Examples may include barrier methods or intrauterine devices (IUDs). Patients using estrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of estrogen deficiency.	Coadministration decreased ethinylestradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 28%, 26% and 33%.  Hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and for up to two months following cessation of telaprevir. During this time, female patients of childbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Two months after completion of telaprevir treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the two required effective methods of birth control.  Patients using oestrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of oestrogen deficiency.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol/norethisterone (0.035/0.5 mg once daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) was studied in  24 subjects. The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of ethinylestradiol decreased by 26%, 28% and 33%, respectively.  Norethisterone Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 15%, 11% and 6%, respectively. Data from 23 subjects showed there was no effect on telaprevir Cmax, AUC or Cmin. Hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and for up to two weeks following cessation of telaprevir. During this time, female patients of childbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Examples may include barrier methods or intrauterine devices (IUDs). Two weeks after completion of telaprevir treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the two required effective methods of birth control; however, specific prescribing information recommendations should be followed for the contraceptives. Patients using estrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of estrogen deficiency.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. The pharmacokinetics of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) and ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone (0.035/0.5 mg once daily) were determined in 24 healthy women.  There was no significant effect on norethindrone or telaprevir exposures.  Ethinyl estradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 28%, 26% and 33%, respectively, which may result in reduced efficacy of estrogen-based contraceptives.  Thus, alternative methods of contraception should be used when estrogen-based contraceptives are coadministered with telaprevir.The pharmacokinetic interaction between an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and telaprevir.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Fluconazole	DB00196	Coadministration has not been studied but could increase telaprevir or fluconazole exposure as both are inhibitors of CYP3A4 albeit telaprevir a more potent one (fluconazole shows moderate inhibition of CYP3A4). Caution should be exercised when using this combination and patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4-5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole. 	Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 2C9 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. There is a risk of increased plasma concentration of other compounds metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 coadministered with fluconazole. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these combinations and the patients should be carefully monitored. The enzyme inhibiting effect of fluconazole persists 4-5 days after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment due to the long half-life of fluconazole.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Flupentixol	DB00875	Co-administration with telaprevir is not recommended due to a cumulative increased risk of QT prolongation and increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Fluphenazine	DB00623	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However, the European SPC for fluphenazine contraindicates it in the presence of other drugs that may prolong the QT interval due to an increased risk of life threatening arrhythmias. The effect of fluphenazine on QT interval is likely to be potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.	The effect of fluphenazine on the QT interval is likely to be  potentiated by concurrent use of other drugs that also prolong the QT  interval. Therefore, concurrent use of these drugs and fluphenazine is  contraindicated. Modecate Summary of Product Characteristics, Sanofi-aventis, February 2013.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Hydromorphone	DB00327	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Hydromorphone is extensively glucuronidated and excreted in the urine mainly as conjugated metabolites. Hydromorphone is a poor inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes and is not expected to alter telaprevir concentrations. Note, use of hydromorphone in patients with ANY degree of hepatic impairment is contraindicated in its European SPC, but the US Prescribing Information does not recommend it for patients with severe hepatic impairment and suggests a dose reduction for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Hydroxychloroquine	DB01611	Coadministration has not been studied. CYP3A4 is likely to have role in the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine. Telaprevir may increase hydroxychloroquine concentrations through CYP3A4 inhibition although the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Monitor for increased hydroxychloroquine side effects. Note, the European SPC for hydroxychloroquine recommends caution in impaired hepatic function.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Hydroxyzine	DB00557	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of hydroxyzine. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely. Note, as hydroxyzine elimination is impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction, daily dose or dose frequency should be reduced in patients with impaired liver function.	As hydroxyzine is metabolized in the liver, an increase in hydroxyzine blood concentrations may be expected when hydroxyzine is co-administered with other drugs known to be potent inhibitors of liver enzymes. The formation of the major metabolite cetirizine, a carboxylic acid metabolite (approximately 45% of the oral dose), is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. This metabolite has significant peripheral H1-antagonist properties. The other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated metabolite, and an O-dealkylated metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4/5. Hydroxyzine inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9/10, 2C19 and 3A4 isoforms at concentrations (IC50: 19 to 140 µM; 7 to 52 µg/ml) well above peak plasma concentrations. Therefore, hydroxyzine is unlikely to impair the metabolism of drugs which are substrates for these enzymes. The metabolite cetirizine at 100 µM has no inhibitory effect on human liver cytochrome P450 (1A2, 2A6, 2C9/C10, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) and UDP-glucuronyl transferase isoforms. As hydroxyzine elimination is impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction, daily dose or dose frequency should be reduced in patients with impaired liver function.

Imipramine and desipramine are both metabolised by CYP2D6. Telaprevir could potentially increase imipramine concentrations.  Monitor side effects and consider a dose reduction if required.  A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Indapamide	DB00808	Coadministration has not been studied. In vitro data suggest that indapamide is metabolised by CYP3A4. Telaprevir may increase indapamide concentrations via CYP3A4 inhibition. The clinical significance of this is unknown but monitor for increased side effects of indapamide and consider a dose reduction if required. The concentration of telaprevir is unlikely to be affected. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Indinavir	DB00224	Coadministration has not been studied but would be expected to increase telaprevir concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A4 by indinavir. However, data from interaction studies with other boosted HIV protease inhibitors have shown telaprevir concentrations to decrease.  Concentrations of indinavir, a substrate of CYP3A4, may be increased through inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir, but the effect is difficult to predict from the currently available interaction studies.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Indometacin		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Indometacin is predominantly acylated and then glucuronidated and there is no evidence of CYP mediated interactions.	(See Summary)

Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy may occur and may develop even after many months of treatment.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Isotretinoin	DB00982	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Isotretinoin is metabolized mainly by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 with participation from CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 and no single isoform appearing to have a predominant role.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ispaghula husk		Coadministration has not been studied. The mode of action of ispaghula husk is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. However, ispaghula husk may delay or reduce gastrointestinal absorption of other drugs and it is advisable to separate administration if possible.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Isradipine	DB00270	Coadministration has not been studied. Concentrations of isradipine may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp by telaprevir. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure, and for side effects such as oedema, postural hypotension and headache.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Itraconazole	DB01167	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of telaprevir and itraconazole as both are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Use with caution. High doses of itraconazole (>200 mg/day) are not recommended. Clinical monitoring of itraconazole is recommended. 	Coadministration may increase itraconazole concentrations.  When co-administration is required, high doses of itraconazole (> 200 mg/day) are not recommended. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended for itraconazole.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Concomitant systemic use of itraconazole with telaprevir may increase plasma concentrations of telaprevir. Plasma concentrations of itraconazole may be increased in the presence of telaprevir. When co-administration is required, high doses of itraconazole (greater than 200 mg/day) are not recommended. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended for itraconazole.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ivabradine	DB09083	Coadministration has not been studied. Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated as it is likely to increase ivabradine concentrations which may be associated with the risk of excessive bradycardia. 	The concomitant use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated with ivabradine.Procoralan SPC, Servier Laboratories Ltd, October 2012.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ivermectin	DB00602	Co-administration has not been studied. Ivermectin is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Ketoconazole	DB01026	Coadministration increased telaprevir Cmax and AUC by 24% and 62%. Ketoconazole concentrations increased in the presence of telaprevir. High ketoconazole doses (>200 mg/day) are not recommended. QT interval prolongation has been reported with ketoconazole. In the event that co-administration is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended.	Coadministration with 200 mg ketoconazole increased ketoconazole AUC and Cmax by 2.25- and 1.75-fold.  When coadministered with 400 mg ketoconazole, telaprevir AUC and Cmax increased by 62% and 24%, and ketoconazole AUC and Cmax increased by 46% and 23%.  When co-administration is required, high doses of ketoconazole (> 200 mg/day) are not recommended.  QT interval prolongation has been reported with ketoconazole. Caution is recommended when prescribing telaprevir concurrently with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and which are CYP3A substrates such as ketoconazole. Telaprevir may increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal product and this may result in an increased risk of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. In the event that co-administration of such medicinal products with telaprevir is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of ketoconazole (400 mg single dose) and telaprevir (750 mg single dose) to 17 subjects, increased telaprevir Cmax by 24% and AUC by 62%. Coadministration of a 400 mg single dose of ketoconazole with telaprevir (1250 mg every 8 hours) to 81 subjects increased ketoconazole Cmax by 23% and AUC by 46%. Coadministration of a 200 mg single dose of ketoconazole with telaprevir (1250 mg every 8 hours) increased ketoconazole Cmax by 75% and AUC by 125%.  When co-administration is required, high doses of ketoconazole (greater than 200 mg/day) are not recommended. QT interval prolongation has been reported with ketoconazole.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. The effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of telaprevir was studied in healthy subjects.  Coadministration of single doses of telaprevir (750 mg) and ketoconazole (400 mg) increased telaprevir AUC and Cmax by 62% and 24%, respectively (n=17).  However, at steady state for telaprevir (1250 mg every 8 h), a single dose of ketoconazole (400 mg) had no discernible effect on telaprevir exposure (n=89).The effect of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on the pharmacokinetics of telaprevir.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Ketoprofen	DB01009	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Ketoprofen is mainly glucuronidated and there is no evidence that telaprevir inhibits or induces UGTs.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Labetalol	DB00598	Coadministration has not been studied, but a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.  Minimal information exists on metabolism of labetalol but it is thought to be mainly through conjugation to glucuronides. As there is significant first pass metabolism in the liver, consider monitoring for potential increased side effects when coadministered with telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lacidipine	DB09236	Coadministration has not been studied. Lacidipine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration may increase lacidipine concentrations. Caution is advised and dose titration may be required. Both medications may prolong the QT interval and ECG monitoring should be considered. Note, caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lacosamide	DB06218	Coadministration has not been studied. Lacosamide is metabolised by CYP3A4 and caution is recommended with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as telaprevir which may increase systemic exposure of lacosamide. Monitor for increased side effects.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lactulose	DB00581	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Metabolism of lactulose to lactic acid occurs via gastro-intestinal microbial flora only.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lamivudine	DB00709	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as lamivudine is not metabolised via CYP enzymatic pathways.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lamivudine (HBV)	DB00709	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as lamivudine is not metabolised via CYP enzymatic pathways.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lamotrigine	DB00555	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Lamotrigine is metabolised by UDP-glucuronyl transferases and there is no evidence that it causes clinically significant induction or inhibition of hepatic oxidative drug-metabolising enzymes. 	UDP-glucuronyl transferases have been identified as the enzymes responsible for metabolism of lamotrigine.  There is no evidence that lamotrigine causes clinically significant induction or inhibition of hepatic oxidative drug-metabolising enzymes, and interactions between lamotrigine and medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely to occur.Lamictal Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, July 2011.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lanreotide	DB06791	Coadministration has not been studied. The limited data available indicate the somatostatin analogues, such as lanreotide, may increase concentrations of cytochrome P450 substrates such as telaprevir. As a possible interaction cannot be excluded, it is recommended if coadministered to monitor for excess side effects and to adjust the dose if appropriate.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lansoprazole	DB00448	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of telaprevir through inhibition of CYP3A4. Lansoprazole is partly metabolised by CYP3A4. It is unclear whether inhibition of this pathway by telaprevir would result in a clinically significant interaction. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lapatinib	DB01259	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Concentrations of lapatinib may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition by telaprevir. If coadministration is unavoidable, a dose decrease of lapatinib will be required. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Coadministration with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has not been studied and is not recommended.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lercanidipine	DB00528	Coadministration has not been studied but is likely to lead to a substantial increase in lercanidipine concentrations.  Coadministration of lercanidipine with strong inhibitors or CYP3A4 is contraindicated.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Letrozole	DB01006	Coadministration has not been studied. Letrozole is metabolised via CYP3A4 and concentrations may be increased via inhibition of this enzyme by telaprevir. Patients should be monitored for increased side effects if these drugs are coadministered.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Levetiracetam	DB01202	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely.  Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans and production of the primary metabolite is not mediated by liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.	Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolised in humans. Production of the primary metabolite is not supported by liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  In vitro, levetiracetam and its primary metabolite have been shown not to inhibit the major human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP3A4, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 1A2), glucuronyl transferase (UGT1A1 and UGT1A6) and epoxide hydroxylase activities.  Levetiracetam caused mild induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. The in vitro data and in vivo interaction data on oral contraceptives, digoxin and warfarin indicate that no significant enzyme induction is expected in vivo. Therefore, the interaction of Keppra with other substances, or vice versa, is unlikely. Keppra Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Ltd, October 2011.In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes.Keppra Prescribing Information, UCB Inc, December 2011.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Levocetirizine	DB06282	Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as less than 14% of a dose of levocetirizine is metabolised.	The extent of metabolism of levocetirizine in humans is less than 14% of the dose. Due to its low metabolism and absence of metabolic inhibition potential, the interaction of levocetirizine with other substances, or vice-versa, is unlikely. No interaction studies have been performed with levocetirizine (including no studies with CYP3A4 inducers); studies with the racemate compound cetirizine demonstrated that there were no clinically relevant adverse interactions.Xyzal Summary of Product Characteristics, UCB Pharma Ltd, December 2010.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Levofloxacin	DB01137	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as levofloxacin is metabolised to a very small extent. However, levofloxacin may cause QT prolongation - caution and potentially ECG monitoring may be required if coadministered with telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Levomepromazine		Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as levomepromazine is metabolised by CYP2D6. However, caution is advised if levomepromazine is coadministered with drug(s) liable to prolong the QT interval and ECG monitoring is recommended.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Levothyroxine	DB00451	Co-administration has not been studied and thyroid metabolism is complicated. The major pathway is sequential deiodination (but there are few published data on the enzymes involved) and conjugation with glucuronides and sulphates also occurs.  A few individual case reports indicate some potential CYP involvement but this is unlikely to be clinically significant. Telaprevir can ‘commonly’ cause hypothyroidism and thyroid function should be monitored whilst on treatment. A sharp rise in thyroid stimulating hormone levels was observed in 4 patients on levothyroxine who started telaprevir, ribavirin and peg interferon alfa 2a HCV therapy. This increase persisted despite increases in levothyroxine doses but resolved with cessation of telaprevir (ribavirin and interferon were continued to completion of therapy).	Four patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine were started on telaprevir, ribavirin and peg interferon alfa 2a HCV therapy. In all four patients a sharp rise in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed which persisted despite increases in levothyroxine doses and asking the patients to take levothyroxine on an empty stomach and at least 2 hours before any food or medications. After telaprevir was discontinued, TSH levels returned rapidly to normal. Telaprevir interferes with levorthyroxine treatment of hypothyroidism. Kraft K, et al. Hepatol, 2012, 56 (Suppl 1): 1053A (Abstract 1845).
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lidocaine (Lignocaine)	DB00281	Coadministration has not been studied, but may increase lidocaine concentrations (via inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir) and produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events. Use with caution. Clinical monitoring is recommended. 	Coadministration with intravenous lidocaine may increase concentrations of lidocaine.  Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended when intravenous lidocaine is administered for the treatment of acute ventricular arrhythmia.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration with telaprevir may increase concentrations of antiarrhythmics with the potential to produce serious and/or life-threatening adverse events and has not been studied. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended when coadministered with telaprevir.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Linaclotide	DB08890	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linaclotide is metabolised locally within the gastrointestinal tract and extensive studies have shown no CYP or transporter interactions occur.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Linagliptin	DB08882	Coadministration has not been studied. Linagliptin is a substrate of and mild to moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp. However, data with ritonavir (a potent 3A4/P-gp inhibitor) indicate that despite an increase in linagliptin exposure, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors due to the large safety window of linagliptin.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Linezolid	DB00601	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Linezolid is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and it does not inhibit any of the clinically significant human CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4).	Linezolid is not detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system and it does not inhibit any of the clinically significant human CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Similarly, linezolid does not induce P450 isoenzymes in rats. Therefore, no CYP450-induced drug interactions are expected with linezolid.  The pharmacokinetics of linezolid in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (i.e. Child-Pugh class C) have not been evaluated. However, as linezolid is metabolised by a non-enzymatic process, impairment of hepatic function would not be expected to significantly alter its metabolism.Zyvox Summary of Product Characteristics, Pharmacia Ltd, July 2011.In vitro studies have demonstrated that linezolid is minimally metabolized and may be mediated by human cytochrome P450. However, the metabolic pathway of linezolid is not fully understood. Linezolid is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) in rats. In addition, linezolid does not inhibit the activities of clinically significant human CYP isoforms (e.g., 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4). Therefore, linezolid is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolized by these major enzymes.Zyvox Prescribing Information, Pharmacia & Upjohn, November 2011.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Liraglutide	DB06655	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Liraglutide is metabolised in a similar manner to large proteins with no specific organ having been identified as major route of elimination.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lisinopril	DB00722	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted entirely unchanged into the urine. Note, lisinopril exposure is increased in cirrhotic patients due to decreased clearance.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lithium	DB01356	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Lithium is excreted almost exclusively in the urine by the kidneys. Lithium should be avoided in patients concomitantly treated with drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lixisenatide	DB09265	Coadministration has not been studied. Lixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. However, delayed gastric emptying due to lixisenatide may reduce absorption of orally administered medicinal products. Telaprevir should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Loperamide	DB00836	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase loperamide concentrations. Loperamide is extensively metabolised in the liver and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Coadministration of loperamide with P-glycoprotein inhibitors (quinidine or ritonavir) increased loperamide concentrations by 2 to 3-fold . Coadministration of loperamide and ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein) increased loperamide concentrations by 5-fold. The clinical relevance of this is unknown. Note, use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment as no pharmacokinetic data are available and in such patients reduced first pass metabolism may result in a relative overdose leading to CNS toxicity.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Lopinavir	DB01601	Coadministration is not recommended as it decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 53%, 54% and 52%, respectively. There was no significant effect on lopinavir (Cmax decreased by 4%, but AUC and Cmin increased by 6% and 14%).	Coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir decreased telaprevir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 54%, 53% and 52%, respectively.  Lopinavir AUC increased by 6%, Cmax decreased by 4% and Cmin increased by 14%.  It is not recommended to co-administer lopinavir/ritonavir and telaprevir.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Concomitant administration of telaprevir and lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in reduced steady-state telaprevir exposure, while the steady-state exposure to lopinavir was not affected. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) to 12 subjects decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 53%, 54% and 52%, respectively. Lopinavir Cmax decreased by 4%, but AUC and Cmin increased by 6% and 14%. It is not recommended to coadminister lopinavir/ritonavir and telaprevir.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was studied in HIV- and HCV-negative subjects.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Loratadine	DB00455	Coadministration has not been studied. Telaprevir may increase loratadine concentrations via inhibition of CYP3 A4 causing an increase in adverse effects. However, these are unlikely to be clinically significant and no a priori dose change is warranted.	(See Summary)

Telaprevir	DB05521	Mefloquine	DB00358	Coadministration has not been studied. Mefloquine is metabolised via CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir may increase mefloquine concentrations and increase the potential risk of adverse reactions. In addition, both mefloquine and telaprevir are substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and concentrations of both may be increased although the clinical relevance of increases via mechanism is uncertain. QT monitoring should be considered when CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as telaprevir are co-prescribed. Note, the use of mefloquine in patients with severe impairment of liver function is contraindicated in the European SPC for mefloquine, but not in the US Prescribing Information.	(See Summary)

Telaprevir	DB05521	Metamizole	DB04817	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Metamizole has been shown to induce CYP3A4 in vitro and could potentially decrease telaprevir exposure which may lead to the loss of efficacy. In addition, there may be increased risk of anaemia in patients taking metamizole. In 2 randomised phase II clinical studies (Prove 1, Prove 2), a decrease in hemoglobin levels was more common in patients receiving telaprevir-based regimens than in controls during the first 12 weeks of treatment.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Methadone	DB00333	Coadministration decreased methadone exposure by ~30-40%. No adjustment of methadone dose is required when initiating telaprevir. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as methadone dose adjustment may be required in some patients. QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported with methadone. ECG should be monitored at baseline and regularly during telaprevir treatment.	Use telaprevir with caution in patients with a requirement for medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval but the metabolism of which is not mainly CYP3A4 dependent (e.g. methadone). Coadministration decreased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of R-methadone by 29%, 29% and 31%, respectively, with no effect on unbound R-methadoneconcentrations. No adjustment of methadone dose is required when initiating co-administration of telaprevir. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as the dose of methadone during maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. QT interval prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported with methadone. ECG should be monitored at baseline and regularly during telaprevir treatment.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Concentrations of methadone were reduced when co-administered with telaprevir. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) to 15 subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy (40-120 mg/daily) decreased the Cmax, AUC and Cmin of R-methadone by 29%, 29% and 31% and decreased S-methadone by 35%, 36% and 40%, respectively. No adjustment of methadone dose is required when initiating co-administration of telaprevir. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as the dose of methadone during maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.  The effect of telaprevir (750 mg q8h) on the pharmacokinetic of methadone was investigated in 16 HCV-negative subjects stable on methadone maintenance therapy (40-120 mg/day, median 85 mg/day). Coadministration decreased the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of R-methadone by 29%, 29% and 31% respectively.  The AUC ratio of S-/R-methadone was comparable before and during coadministration of telaprevir, indicating a lack of stereo-specific effect.  Coadministration increased the median unbound fraction of R-methadone from 7.92% to 9.98%, and the estimated median (absolute) unbound Cmin of R-methadone was comparable before (10.63 ng/ml) and during coadministration of telaprevir (10.45 ng/ml).  During coadministration, fewer volunteers experienced withdrawal symptoms and the median resting pupil diameter was smaller, compared with treatment with methadone alone.  Although total exposure to R-methadone (the active form) was reduced by approximately 30% during telaprevir coadministration, there was no indication of opioid withdrawal. This is consistent with the observation that unbound concentrations of R-methadone were not affected by telaprevir. These findings in HCV-negative volunteers suggest that a-priori adjustment of the methadone dose is not required when initiating telaprevir. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as individual dose modifications may be necessary.The pharmacokinetic interaction between methadone and the investigational HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir. van Heeswijk R, et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of Hepatitis Therapy, June 2011, abstract PK_18. Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) and methadone was studied in an open-label, single-sequence trial in 18 HCV-negative volunteers on individualised methadone maintenance therapy (40-120 mg/day). PK profiles of R- (active) and S-methadone were measured at day 1 (without telaprevir) and day 7.  Unbound R-methadone was also determined.  The LS Means ratio (90% CI) of the Cmin, Cmax and AUC24h for R-methadone was 0.69 (0.64-0.75), 0.71 (0.66-0.76) and 0.71 (0.66-0.76), respectively.  However, despite the decrease in total exposure of the active methadone there was an increase in the unbound fraction from 7.9 to 10.0% during telaprevir co-administration. This meant that the estimated unbound R-methadone Cmin remained unchanged before (10.63 ng/ml) and after (10.45 ng/ml) telaprevir. There was no indication of opioid withdrawal and the findings suggest that no a-priori adjustment of methadone is required when initiating telaprevir.  However clinical monitoring is recommended.The pharmacokinetic interaction between methadone and the investigational HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir. van Heeswijk R, et al. 46th Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), Berlin 2011, Abstract 654 (poster 1244).

Telaprevir	DB05521	Nitrendipine	DB01054	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase nitrendipine concentrations.  Nitrendipine is extensively metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 (and possibly other CYPs) and <1% is recovered in urine as unchanged drug.  There is the potential for an increase in nitrendipine exposure when given with telaprevir.  Use with caution.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Nitrofurantoin	DB00698	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Approximately 30-40% of a nitrofurantoin dose is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys, with a small proportion metabolized to aminofurantoin.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Norethisterone (Norethindrone)	DB00717	Coadministration decreased norethisterone Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 15%, 11% and 6%, respectively, but had no significant effect on telaprevir concentrations. No significant interaction is expected when norethisterone is used in a progestogen-only contraceptive. Combined (estrogen + progestogen) hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and for up to two weeks following cessation of telaprevir. Female patients of childbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Examples may include barrier methods or intrauterine devices (IUDs).	Coadministration decreased norethindrone AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 11%, 15% and 6%. Hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and for up to two months following cessation of telaprevir. During this time, female patients of childbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Two months after completion of telaprevir treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the two required effective methods of birth control.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol/norethisterone (0.035/0.5 mg once daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) was studied in  24 subjects. The Cmax, AUC and Cmin of ethinylestradiol decreased by 26%, 28% and 33%, respectively.  Norethisterone Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 15%, 11% and 6%, respectively. Data from 23 subjects showed exposure to norethisterone was not altered when co-administered with telaprevir. Hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during telaprevir dosing and for up to two weeks following cessation of telaprevir. During this time, female patients of childbearing potential should use two effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Examples may include barrier methods or intrauterine devices (IUDs). Two weeks after completion of telaprevir treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the two required effective methods of birth control; however, specific prescribing information recommendations should be followed for the contraceptives. Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. The pharmacokinetics of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) and ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone (0.035/0.5 mg once daily) were determined in 24 healthy women.  There was no significant effect on norethindrone or telaprevir exposures.  Ethinyl estradiol AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 28%, 26% and 33%, respectively, which may result in reduced efficacy of estrogen-based contraceptives.  Thus, alternative methods of contraception should be used when estrogen-based contraceptives are coadministered with telaprevir.The pharmacokinetic interaction between an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and telaprevir.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Olmesartan	DB00275	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Note, the European SPC for olmesartan recommends an initial 10 mg dose of olmesartan (with a maximum 20 mg daily dose) in moderate hepatic impairment. It does not recommend olmersartan in severe hepatic impairment. No dosage restrictions are given in the US Prescribing Information.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Omalizumab	DB00043	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the metabolism and clearance of omalizumab.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Omeprazole	DB00338	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase omeprazole concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A. As CYP3A is a minor route of metabolism for omeprazole, this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance. The effect of omeprazole on telaprevir exposure is unlikely to be clinically significant. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Ondansetron	DB00904	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Note, ondansetron clearance is significantly reduced and half-life significantly increased in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; in such patients a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded and parenteral or oral administration is recommended.	Ondansetron is metabolised by multiple hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes: CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 5% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Due to the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolising ondansetron, enzyme inhibition or reduced activity of one enzyme (e.g. CYP2D6 genetic deficiency) is normally compensated by other enzymes and should result in little or no significant change in overall ondansetron clearance or dose requirement. Clearance of ondansetron is significantly reduced and serum half-life significantly prolonged in subjects with moderate or severe impairment of hepatic function. In such patients a total daily dose of 8mg should not be exceeded and therefore parenteral or oral administration is recommended.Zofran Summary of Product Characteristic, GlaxoSmithKline UK, February 2012.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Orlistat	DB01083	Coadministration has not been studied. Orlistat is minimally absorbed after oral doses with about 97% of a dose excreted in the faeces, 83% of which as unchanged orlistat. A clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely, however, because of its effect on fat absorption in the GI tract, it cannot be ruled out that absorption of telaprevir could be reduced.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Orphenadrine	DB01173	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Orphenadrine is an inhibitor CYP2B6, but this enzyme is not involved in the metabolism of boceprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Oseltamivir	DB00198	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Oseltamivir is converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases and telaprevir is unlikely to play a role in this process.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Oxaliplatin	DB00526	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Oxaliplatin undergoes non enzymatic biotransformation and is eliminated renally by OCT2, MATE2-K and, to a lesser extent, MATE-1.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Oxamniquine	DB01096	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Limited data suggest that oxamniquine is likely to be a substrate of CYP2D6 which is not affected by telaprevir.	(See Summary)

Telaprevir	DB05521	Oxcarbazepine	DB00776	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Telaprevir concentrations may be reduced due to induction of CYP3A4 by oxcarbazepine. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Oxprenolol	DB01580	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely as oxprenolol is largely metabolised via glucuronidation. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Oxycodone	DB00497	Coadministration has not been studied. Oxycodone is metabolised principally to noroxycodone via CYP3A4 and oxymorphone via CYP2D6. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir may increase the analgesic effects of oxycodone. Monitor the analgesic effect and for signs of opiate toxicity. Note, use of oxycodone in patients with moderate to severe hepatic failure is contraindicated in the European SPC but not in the US Prescribing Information.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Paliperidone	DB01267	Coadministration has not been studied. Paliperidone is a substrate of P-gp and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of P-gp by telaprevir. Monitor for increased side effects and decrease dose if required. ECG monitoring is recommended as both drugs may prolong QTc interval. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Pamidronate	DB00282	Coadministration with pamidronate has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Pamidronate is not hepatically metabolised and is almost exclusively renally excreted.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Pantoprazole	DB00213	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase pantoprazole concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A. As CYP3A is a minor route of metabolism for pantoprazole, this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance. The effect of pantoprazole on telaprevir exposure is unlikely to be clinically significant. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Paracetamol		Not Available	Not Available
Telaprevir	DB05521	Paroxetine	DB00715	Coadministration has not been studied. Paroxetine is mainly metabolised by CYP2D6 with a minor CYP3A4 component.  Telaprevir could potentially increase paroxetine concentrations to a small extent.  A clinically significant effect on telaprevir is unlikely.	The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes.  When paroxetine is to be co-administered with a known drug metabolising enzyme inhibitor, consideration should be given to using paroxetine doses at the lower end of the range. Seroxat Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, June 2010.The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes. An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics.  Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s in vitro Ki and its lack of effect on terfenadine’s in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.Paxil Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, August 2011.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Peg-IFN alfa		Telaprevir must not be administered as monotherapy and must only be prescribed in combination with both peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Coadministration of peginterferon did not appear to have an effect on telaprevir Cmax. However, the study was limited by small sample size and parallel group design. 	Telaprevir must not be administered as monotherapy and must only be prescribed in combination with both peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Telaprevir must not be administered as monotherapy and must only be prescribed with both peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. Coadministration of telaprevir alone (750 mg three times daily, n=8) or peginterferon alfa-2a alone (180 µg per week, n=4) or the combination (n=8) was studied in HCV-infected subjects.  Telaprevir Cmax on the first day of dosing did not differ significantly when given alone (3695 ng/ml) or with peginterferon (3391 ng/ml).  At steady state (day 14), there was a trend towards higher telaprevir exposure in the combination group, but this did not reach statistical significance.  Due to study limitation (small sample size, parallel design) no definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effect of telaprevir on peginterferon.  Peginterferon concentrations in both groups were within the range given in the product label.Antiviral activity of telaprevir (VX-950) and peginterferon alfa-2b in patients with hepatitis C.  Forestier N, et al.  Hepatol, 2007, 46(3): 640-648.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Penicillamine	DB00859	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as multiple mechanisms are thought to be involved in the metabolism of penicillamine.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Penicillin V		Coadministration has not been studied, but based on the metabolism/elimination and toxicity profiles of both drugs, there is little potential for interaction. Penicillin V is predominantly eliminated via the kidneys.	(See Summary)

Telaprevir	DB05521	Perampanel	DB08883	Coadministration has not been studied. Perampanel is metabolised by CYP3A4 and concentrations may increase due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Although perampanel is an inducer of CYP3A4, a clinically significant effect on telaprevir is unlikely. In the absence of further data, monitor for increased side effects and virological response.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Perazine		Coadministration has not been studied but is not recommended due to the potential increase in concentrations of perazine or telaprevir by CYP3A4 inhibition. Cardiac conduction abnormalities have been associated with perazine and ECG monitoring is recommended in combination with telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Pericyazine		Coadministration has not been studied. The metabolism of pericyazine has not been well characterised but is likely to involve CYP2D6. A marked interaction would not be expected, but cannot be excluded due to the absence of conclusive data. Monitoring for side effects associated with increased concentrations is suggested. Cardiac conduction abnormalities, including QT prolongation, may be seen with pericyazine, so clinical monitoring of this is also recommended. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Perindopril	DB00790	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Perindopril is a prodrug metabolised in the liver by a non-CYP mechanism to the active metabolite. Perindopril can commonly cause rash which should be considered if started recently and given in combination with telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Perphenazine	DB00850	Coadministration has not been studied, but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However, use with concomitant QT prolonging drugs is not recommended unless benefit thought to outweigh the risk. ECG monitoring would be required for concomitant use with telaprevir.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Pethidine (Meperidine)	DB00454	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as pethidine is metabolised mainly by CYP2B6.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Phencyclidine	DB03575	Co-administration has not been studied and is not recommended. In vitro data suggest that phencyclidine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and telaprevir may theoretically increase phencyclidine concentrations. Phencyclidine may increase telaprevir concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant. Monitor for signs of toxicity of both drugs. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Phenobarbital	DB01174	Coadministration is contraindicated as it may decrease telaprevir concentrations and alter phenobarbital concentrations.

Potent CYP3A inducers, such as phenobarbital are contraindicated.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Coadministration is contraindicated due to the potential for lower exposure and loss of efficacy of telaprevir.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Phenprocoumon	DB00946	Coadministration has not been studied. Phenprocoumon is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Telaprevir may increase phenprocoumon exposure by inhibition of CYP3A4 but the magnitude of the interaction is difficult to predict given that phenprocoumon is also metabolized by CYP2C9 and partly excreted unchanged. Monitor INR closely.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Phenylephrine	DB00388	Coadministration has not been studied. The metabolism of phenylephrine has not been well described but there are limited reports of CYP1A2 involvement. A clinically significant interaction is unlikely as telaprevir has no effect on CYP1A2, there are no reports of CYP3A4 or P-gp drug interactions with phenylephrine, and phenylephrine is normally only used for a maximum of 7 days. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Phenytoin	DB00252	Coadministration is contraindicated as it decreases exposure of telaprevir which may lead to the loss of efficacy. Coadministration of phenytoin (200 mg twice daily) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h) decreased telaprevir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 32%, 47% and 68%, respectively and increased phenytoin Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 27%, 31% and 36%, respectively.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Rifapentine	DB01201	Coadministration has not been studied but may decrease concentrations of telaprevir through induction of CYP3A4. Concentrations of rifapentine are unlikely to be altered. 	Rifapentine is an inducer of cytochromes P4503A4 and P4502C8/9. Therefore, rifapentine may increase the metabolism of other coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Induction of enzyme activities by rifapentine occurred within 4 days after the first dose. Enzyme activities returned to baseline levels 14 days after discontinuing rifapentine. In addition, the magnitude of enzyme induction by rifapentine was dose and dosing frequency dependent; less enzyme induction occurred when 600 mg oral doses of rifapentine were given once every 72 hours versus daily. In vitro and in vivo enzyme induction studies have suggested rifapentine induction potential may be less than rifampin but more potent than rifabutin.  Rifapentine does not induce its own metabolism.Priftin Prescribing Information, Sanofi-Aventis US, May 2010.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Rifaximin	DB01220	Coadministration has not been studied. Clinically significant drug interactions are not expected in patients with normal liver function. Rifaximin had no significant effect on midazolam, ethinylestradiol or norgestimate exposure in healthy subjects. It is unknown whether rifaximin will have a significant effect on CYP3A4 substrates in patients with elevated rifaximin concentrations, such as those with reduced liver function. Note, caution should be exercised when rifamixin is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.	Due to the negligible gastrointestinal absorption of orally administered rifaximin (less than 1%), the systemic drug interaction potential is low.  In vitro data show that rifaximin is a weak inducer of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the P450 cytochrome. Drug-drug interaction studies investigating the clinical interaction between rifaximin and drugs metabolised by the human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes demonstrated that rifaximin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Therefore, clinical interactions with drugs metabolised by these isoenzymes are not expected.  The potential for drug-drug interactions to occur at the level of gut transporter systems has not been evaluated and cannot be ruled out.Xifaxanta Summary of Product Characteristics, Norgine Limited, June 2011.In vitro studies have shown that rifaximin did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and CYP3A4 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng/mL. Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use. In an in vitro study, rifaximin was shown to induce CYP3A4 at the concentration of 0.2 μM. However, in patients with normal liver function, rifaximin at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4.  The effect of rifaximin on CYP3A4 in patients with impaired liver function who have elevated systemic exposure is not known. An in vitro study suggests that rifaximin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. In the presence of P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil, the efflux ratio of rifaximin was reduced greater than 50% in vitro. The effect of P-glycoprotein inhibition on rifaximin was not evaluated in vivo.  The inhibitory effect of rifaximin on P-gp transporter was observed in an in vitro study. The effect of rifaximin on P-gp transporter was not evaluated in vivo.Xifaxan Prescribing Information, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, November 2010.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Ritonavir	DB00503	Coadministration of single doses of ritonavir and telaprevir increased telaprevir Cmax (30%) and AUC (2-fold). However, multiple dose studies showed telaprevir Cmax, Caverage and Cmin decreased by 15%, 24% and 32%, respectively (when compared to telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone).	Coadministration of ritonavir (100 mg single dose) and telaprevir (750 mg single dose) to 14 subjects increased telaprevir Cmax by 30% and AUC by 2-fold. A multiple dose study in 5 subjects of ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and telaprevir (750 mg twice daily) decreased telaprevir Cmax, Caverage and Cmin by 15%, 24% and 32%, respectively (when compared to telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours alone).Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. This study evaluated whether giving lower doses of telaprevir twice daily with ritonavir would achieve equivalent exposure to telaprevir three times daily. The pharmacokinetics of telaprevir and ritonavir (250/100 mg or 750/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) or telaprevir alone (750 mg every 8 h for 14 days) were determined in groups (n=6) of healthy subjects in a open-label, randomised, parallel group study.  Following multiple doses of telaprevir and ritonavir, no significant boosting of telaprevir exposure by ritonavir was observed.  When compared to telaprevir alone (750 mg every 8 h), coadministration of telaprevir/ritonavir (750/100 mg twice daily) decreased telaprevir Cmax, Cavg and Cmin by 15%, 24% and 32% respectively.  Coadministration of lower dose telaprevir/ritonavir combination decreased telaprevir concentrations by 59-75%.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Sorafenib	DB00398	Caution is advised as sorafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although no interaction was observed with ketoconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4), coadministration with telaprevir has not been studied. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely. Sorafenib has been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 	Sorafenib is metabolised primarily in the liver and undergoes oxidative metabolism, mediated by CYP 3A4, as well as glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, administered once daily for 7 days to healthy male volunteers did not alter the mean AUC of a single 50 mg dose of sorafenib. These data suggest that clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of sorafenib with CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely. However caution is necessary. Sorafenib has been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Nexavar Summary of Product Characteristics, Bayer PLC, October 2011.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Sunitinib	DB01268	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase concentrations of sunitinib due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir, causing potential for serious and or life threatening events. Coadministration is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Use with caution.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Tacrolimus	DB00864	Coadministration markedly increased concentrations of tacrolimus. Dose normalised data showed tacrolimus Cmax increased by 9.35-fold and AUC increased by 70.3-fold. Significant dose reductions and prolongation of the dosing interval of tacrolimus to achieve target concentration should be anticipated. Close monitoring of the immunosuppressant blood levels, and frequent assessments of renal function and immunosuppressant-related side effects are recommended. Tacrolimus may prolong the QT interval. In the event that co-administration is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended. Appropriate tacrolimus concentrations were achieved in 7 HCV-infected liver transplant patients from a single centre by reducing the tacrolimus dose by a half and decreasing the dosing frequency to once a week. Despite some fluctuations in the tacrolimus levels outside the therapeutic range (4-8 ng/ml), there were no episodes of acute rejection or tacrolimus toxicity during the study period.	Coadministration increased tacrolimus AUC and Cmax by 70.3- and 9.35-fold (calculated based on data obtained with reduced dose). Concentrations of telaprevir may be increased. Significant immunosuppressant dose reductions and prolongation of the dosing intervals will be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant blood levels, renal function and immunosuppressant related side effects are recommended when co-administered with telaprevir.  Tacrolimus may prolong the QT interval. Caution is recommended when prescribing telaprevir concurrently with medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and which are CYP3A substrates such as tacrolimus. Telaprevir may increase concentrations of the co-administered medicinal product and this may result in an increased risk of their associated cardiac adverse reactions. In the event that co-administration of such medicinal products with telaprevir is judged strictly necessary, clinical monitoring including ECG assessments is recommended.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Plasma concentrations of tacrolimus are markedly increased when co-administered with telaprevir. Coadministration of tacrolimus (2 mg single dose alone, 0.5 mg single dose with telaprevir) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) was studied in 9 subjects. Dose normalised data showed tacrolimus Cmax increased by 9.35-fold and AUC increased by 70.3-fold. Significant dose reductions and prolongation of the dosing interval of the immunosuppressant to achieve the desired blood levels should be anticipated. Close monitoring of the immunosuppressant blood levels, and frequent assessments of renal function and immunosuppressant-related side effects are recommended when co-administered with telaprevir. Tacrolimus may prolong the QT interval. The use of telaprevir in organ transplant patients has not been studied.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013.  The pharmacokinetic interaction between telaprevir and tacrolimus was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers. Tacrolimus was administered alone as a single 2 mg oral dose followed by a minimum of 14 days washout and subsequent coadministration of a single 0.5 mg dose of tacrolimus with steady state telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h). Coadministration increased the tacrolimus dose normalised AUC by 70-fold. Telaprevir has not been studied in organ transplant patients; its use in these patients is not recommended because the required studies have not been completed to understand appropriate dose adjustments needed for safe coadministration of telaprevir with tacrolimus.Effect of telaprevir on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Garg V, et al. Hepatology, 2011, 54(1): 20-27. Seven patients with documented genotype 1 HCV infection post liver transplant were started on triple HCV combination therapy with pegylated interferon alpha 2a or 2b, ribavirin and telaprevir. All patients were stable on tacrolimus prior to start of the antiviral regimen. Based on available pharmacokinetic data of the telaprevir/tacrolimus interaction, on initiation of telaprevir the tacrolimus dose was reduced to approximately half the pre-treatment dose and the frequency was reduced to once a week. Trough tacrolimus levels were checked every other day for the first 2 weeks and then every week thereafter until telaprevir therapy was complete. After completing telaprevir, tacrolimus was re-introduced slowly to pre-telaprevir dosing. Despite some fluctuations in the tacrolimus levels outside the therapeutic range (4-8 ng/ml), there were no episodes of acute rejection or tacrolimus toxicity during the study period. One patient discontinued at 8 weeks due to inadequate virologic response. Adverse events of triple HCV therapy included severe anaemia (requiring blood transfusions in 4 of 7 patients), dehydration, renal insufficiency and infections including a UTI, sepsis, and pneumonia/ARDS that resulted in death in one patient.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Tamoxifen	DB00675	Coadministration has not been studied but may potentially reduce the efficacy of tamoxifen as inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir may reduce the amount of drug converted to endoxifen (a pharmacologically active metabolite). Tamoxifen metabolism occurs mostly via two pathways: the formation of N-desmethyltamoxifen (via mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) is the main route (92%) and the formation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (via CYP2D6 > 2C9/19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) is a minor route (7%). Further metabolism of both metabolites results in the formation of endoxifen which is thought to be the most important metabolite contributing to the pharmacologic activity of tamoxifen. Endoxifen is formed from N-desmethyltamoxifen via CYP2D6 and from 4-hydroxytamoxifen via CYP3A4. 	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Tamsulosin	DB00706	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase tamsulosin concentrations. Tamsulosin is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP2D6.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Terbinafine	DB00857	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Terbinafine is metabolized by at least seven CYPs and the potential for interaction with other drugs is predicted to be low. Note, terbinafine in patients with chronic or active liver disease has not been studied in prospective clinical trials and therefore can not be recommended for such patients.	Terbinafine is rapidly metabolised by the CYP-isoenzymes, mainly by CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19.  The plasma clearance of terbinafine may be accelerated by drugs which induce metabolism (such as rifampicin) and may be inhibited by drugs which inhibit cytochrome P450 (such as cimetidine). Where co-administration of such drugs is required, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of terbinafine accordingly.  In vitro studies have shown, that terbinafine inhibits the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. Other in vitro and clinical studies suggest that terbinafine shows negligible potential to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs that are metabolised via other cytochrome P450 enzymes.In patients with pre-existing mild to severe hepatic impairment, single dose pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the clearance of terbinafine can be reduced by 50%. Therapeutic use of terbinafine in patients with chronic or active liver disease has not been studied in prospective clinical trials, and therefore can not be recommended. Terbinafine is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.Terbinafine Summary of Product Characteristics, Actavis UK Ltd, February 2011.Lamisil tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Lamisil tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease.  Prior to excretion, terbinafine is extensively metabolized by at least seven CYP isoenzymes with major contributions from CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor.Lamisil Prescribing Information, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, November 2011.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Terfenadine	DB00342	Coadministration has not been studied but is likely to increase terfenadine concentrations and the risk of life threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Tipranavir	DB00932	Coadministration has not been studied but would be expected to increase telaprevir concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A4 by tipranavir. However, data from interaction studies with other boosted HIV protease inhibitors have shown telaprevir concentrations to decrease. Concentrations of tipranavir, a substrate of CYP3A4, may be increased through inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir, but the effect is difficult to predict from the currently available interaction studies.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Tizanidine	DB00697	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as tizanidine is metabolised via CYP1A2.	(See Summary)

Telaprevir	DB05521	Venlafaxine	DB00285	Coadministration has not been studied. Venlafaxine is metabolised by CYP2D6 (major) and CYP3A4 and CYP2C9/19. There may be an increase in venlafaxine concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A4. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely.	Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and venlafaxine may increase levels of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Therefore, caution is advised if a patient's therapy includes a CYP3A4 inhibitor and venlafaxine concomitantly. Bonilux XL Summary of Product Characteristics, Sandoz Ltd, April 2009.Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors and venlafaxine may increase levels of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Therefore, caution is advised if a patient's therapy includes a CYP3A4 inhibitor and venlafaxine concomitantly. In vitro studies indicate that venlafaxine is likely metabolized to a minor, less active metabolite, N-desmethylvenlafaxine, by CYP3A4. Because CYP3A4 is typically a minor pathway relative to CYP2D6 in the metabolism of venlafaxine, the potential for a clinically significant drug interaction between drugs that inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism and venlafaxine is small.  Venlafaxine did not inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro.  This finding was confirmed in vivo by clinical drug interaction studies in which venlafaxine did not inhibit the metabolism of several CYP3A4 substrates, including alprazolam, diazepam, and terfenadine.Effexor Prescribing Information, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, January 2010.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Ziprasidone	DB00246	Coadministration with telaprevir has not been studied. Zisprasidone is metabolised by CYP3A4 and coadministration is likely to increase ziprasidone concentrations due to inhibition of CYP3A4 by telaprevir. Coadministration is not recommended due to the potential of life threatening arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. The US Prescribing information contraindicates ziprasidone in the presence of other drugs that prolong the QT interval.	Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies between ziprasidone and other  drugs that prolong the QT interval have not been performed. An additive  effect of ziprasidone and other drugs that prolong the QT interval  cannot be excluded. Therefore, ziprasidone should not be given with  other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their  pharmacodynamic effects.Geodon US Prescribing Information, Pfizer Inc, February 2012.
Telaprevir	DB05521	Zofenopril		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. Zofenopril is a prodrug metabolised in the liver by a non-CYP mechanism to zofenoprilat, the active metabolite.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Zolmitriptan	DB00315	Co-administration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as zolmitriptan is metabolised by CYP1A2.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Zolpidem	DB00425	Coadministration decreased zolpidem Cmax and AUC by 42% and 47%. Clinical monitoring is recommended. Dose titrate zolpidem as required.	Coadministration with zolpidem decreased zolpidem AUC and Cmax by 47% and 42%. The clinical relevance is unknown. Increased dose of zolpidem may be required to maintain efficacy.Incivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2013. Exposure to zolpidem was decreased when co-administered with telaprevir. Coadministration of a zolpidem (5 mg single dose) and telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours) to 19 subjects decreased zolpidem Cmax and AUC by 42% and 47%. Clinical monitoring and dose titration of zolpidem is recommended to achieve the desired clinical response.Incivek Prescribing Information, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, October 2013. The effect of telaprevir on the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem (5 mg sinlge dose) was studied in 20 healthy subjects.  When zolpidem was administered with a single dose of telaprevir (750 mg), zolpidem AUC increased by 14% and Cmax decreased by 1%.  However, following multiple doses of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 h), zolipidem AUC and Cmax decreased by 47% and 42%, respectively.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Zonisamide	DB00909	Co-administration has not been studied. Zonisamide is a weak P-gp inhibitor and there is a theoretical risk of reduced concentrations of telaprevir and/or zonisamide, but the clinical significance of this is unclear. No a priori dose adjustment is required but monitoring for clinical effectiveness and response is recommended.	(See Summary)
Telaprevir	DB05521	Zopiclone	DB01198	Coadministration has not been studied but may increase zopiclone concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A. A clinically significant effect on telaprevir exposure is unlikely. Note, elimination of zopiclone may be reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction and a lower dose of zopiclone nightly is recommended for these patients. Zopiclone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.

Telaprevir	DB05521	Zuclopentixol		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However, zuclopenthixol may cause QT prolongation and coadministration of other drugs known to significantly increase the QT interval should be avoided due to the potential of life threatening arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death.	Increases in the QT interval related to antipsychotic treatment may be  exacerbated by the co administration of other drugs known to  significantly increase the QT interval. Co-administration of such drugs  should be avoided. Clopixol Summary of Product Characteristics, Lunbeck Ltd, January 2012.
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Abacavir	DB01048	No significant pharmacokinetic interaction observed.	Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and abacavir (300 mg single dose) was studied in 8 HIV-negative subjects. There was no change in tenofovir AUC or Cmax; abacavir AUC was unaltered and Cmax increased by 12%. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Limited, March 2010.The plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and abacavir, lamivudine or lopinavir was investigated in HIV+ subjects receiving TDF + 3TC/LPV (n=7), TDF + 3TC/NVP (n=8), TDF + ABC/LPV (n=7) or TDF + ABC/NVP (n=5).

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Acetazolamide	DB00819	Coadministration has not been studied. Acetazolamide is predominantly excreted unchanged via active renal tubular secretion. In vitro studies have shown acetazolamide may competitively inhibit renal transporters hOAT1, hOAT3 and hOAT4. Thus, there is potential for competition with tenofovir for active renal transport mechanisms which may lead to increased levels of either drug. 	(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Aciclovir	DB00787	Coadministration has not been studied. Aciclovir is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine via active renal tubular secretion. Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of the other renally eliminated drug. 	Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of other renally eliminated drugs.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Adefovir		Although clinical studies have demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between adefovir and tenofovir, it is recommended that they are not administered concurrently. 	Adefovir dipivoxil should not be administered concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread).Hepsera Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2009.Adefovir should not be used concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing products including Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate combination tablet) and Atripla (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate combination tablet). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir have been evaluated following single dose adefovir in combination with multiple dose tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg daily) in healthy volunteers (n=22). The pharmacokinetics of adefovir and tenofovir were both unchanged when co-administered.  Hepsera US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, October 2009. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir and adefovir were determined in healthy subjects (n=24) in an open-label, fixed-sequence study. Subjects received 10 mg single doses of adefovir dipivoxil on days 1 and 8 and 300 mg doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on days 2 to 8. The 24 h plasma pharmacokinetics (AUC, Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, t1/2) of tenofovir and adefovir were unaltered upon coadministration and the renal clearances of tenofovir and adefovir were both unaffected. These results demonstrate that coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and adefovir dipivoxil does not result in substantial changes to their individual pharmacokinetic profiles.Systemic and renal pharmacokinetics of adefovir and tenofovir upon coadministration.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Ampicillin	DB00415	This interaction has not been studied. Renal clearance of ampicillin occurs partly by glomerular filtration and partly by tubular secretion. Approximately 20 to 40% of an oral dose and 60 to 80% of a parenteral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.  As lamivudine is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with ampicillin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug when ampicillin is administered intravenously. When administered orally, there is little potential for significant interaction.	(See Summary)

TDM of atazanavir should be considered. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir and an H2 receptor antagonist should be avoided, but if judged necessary, consider increasing atazanavir/ritonavir to 400/100 mg once daily. Coadministration with atazanavir/cobicistat has not been studied.	In a combined analysis from several clinical studies in HIV+ subjects, atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (n=39) was compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg (n=33). Atazanavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin decreased by 22%, 16% and 23%, respectively. Tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively. The efficacy of atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir in treatment-experienced patients has been demonstrated in clinical study 045 and in treatment naive patients in clinical study 138. The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Coadministration of atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir AND an H2 receptor antagonist should be avoided.Reyataz Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, July 2009.Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with tenofovir. Tenofovir may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir. Atazanavir increases tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily) with tenofovir (300 mg once daily), in 34 subjects, caused a 21%, 25% and 40% decrease in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively; tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 14%, 24% and 22%, respectively. When atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) was coadministered with tenofovir (300 mg once daily), in 10 subjects, decreased of 28%, 25% and 23% in atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, respectively, were observed (compared to atazanavir/ritonavir without tenofovir). The geometric mean values for atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin, when coadministered with ritonavir and tenofovir, were 3190 ng/ml, 34459 ng.h/ml and 491 ng/ml, respectively. When coadministered with tenofovir, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir 300 mg (all as a single daily dose with food). Increase atazanavir/ritonavir to 400/100 mg once daily in treatment-experienced patients receiving both tenofovir and a H2-receptor antagonist. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir-associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Patients receiving atazanavir and tenofovir should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse events. Reyataz Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, November 2009.Coadministration of atazanvir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) decreased atazanavir AUC (25%), Cmax (28%) and Cmin (26%). Tenofovir AUC increased by 37%, Cmax increased by 34% and Cmin increased by 29%. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored. Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, July 2009.Coadministration of atazanavir (400 mg once daily for 14 days) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) to 33 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax (14%), AUC (24%) and Cmin (22%). Atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 21%, 25% and 40% respectively. Coadministration of tenofovir and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily for 42 days) decreased atazanavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 28%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. In HIV-infected patients, addition of tenofovir DF to atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg, resulted in AUC and Cmin values of atazanavir that were 2.3- and 4-fold higher than the respective values observed for atazanavir 400 mg when given alone. The mechanism for the increased tenofovir concentrations is unknown. Patients should be monitored for tenofovir associated adverse events. When coadministered with tenofovir, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with tenofovir.Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, March 2010.Atazanavir trough concentrations were determined in 43 HIV+ subjects receiving unboosted atazanavir (400 mg once daily) in the presence of tenofovir. The median trough concentration was 242 (range 106-1100) ng/ml with 8 subjects having low trough concentrations (<150 ng/ml). Following a dose increase to 600 mg once daily in 4/8 subjects, atazanavir trough concentrations were 222-294 ng/ml. Viral load results were available for 36 subjects, 31 of whom were undetectable (<50 copies/ml) at baseline. 30 remained <50 copies/ml and all were <100 copies/ml at last follow up. Five subjects had viral loads >50 copies/ml at baseline, of whom 3 were undetectable at last follow up. Atazanavir trough levels in patients receiving unboosted atazanavir and tenofovir. Harris M, Hull M, Toy J, et al. 10th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Amsterdam, April 2009, abstract P21.The pharmacokinetic effects of the coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and unboosted atazanavir was studied in HIV-negative subjects. A dosing strategy that would provide atazanavir and tenofovir exposures comparable to each drug when dosed alone was evaluated. The strategies employed were dosing the ATV (400 mg once daily) and TDF 12 hours apart and increasing the ATV dose to 600 mg once daily. The temporal 12 hour separation of ATV 400 mg resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC, Cmin of 10%, 17%, and 28%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 43%, 37%, and 38%, respectively. The simultaneous administration of 600 mg ATV with TDF resulted in a decrease in ATV Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 27%, 36%, and 41%, respectively and an increase in TDF Cmax, AUC and Cmin of 41%, 59%, and 74%, respectively. Based on these findings the authors continue to recommend that when co-dosed with TDF, ATV (300 mg once daily) should be combined with RTV (100 mg once daily). Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala S, et al. 3rd IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, Rio de Janiero, July 2005, abstract WePe3.3C07. A study was performed in healthy volunteers to determine whether increasing ATV/RTV from 300/100 mg to 400/100 mg once daily with TDF, or maintaining the standard dose but separating administration of TDF by 12 h, could overcome the 25% decrease in ATV exposure previously seen when coadministered with TDF. Relative to ATV/RTV 300/100, simultaneous administration of ATV/RTV 400/100 resulted in increases in ATV AUC and Cmin of 38% and 33% respectively. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 55% and 70% respectively. Maintaining the standard dose, but separating administration by 12 h, resulted in an 11% decrease in ATV AUC and a 20% decrease in Cmin. TDF AUC and Cmin increased by 37% and 29% respectively. RTV exposure was comparable across treatments. Due to the increases in ATV and higher TDF exposures, coadministration of ATV/RTV 400/100 mg with TDF is not recommended. Separation of ATV/RTV 300/100 mg and TDF doses is not expected to offer any additional clinical advantage over simultaneous administration. Pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir in healthy subjects. Agarwala, S et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 16.The pharmacokinetics of TDF (300 mg once daily) when given with ATV/RTV (300/100 mg once daily) were assessed in a substudy of the Puzzle2-ANRS 107 trial. Full PK profiles were determined in 10 patients: median (range) TDF Cmax, Cmin and AUC were 234 (121-855) ng/ml, 45 (23-215) ng/ml and 2253 (1305-11285) ng/ml.h respectively. Trough concentrations at weeks 6, 10, 18 and 26 were 58, 64, 53 and 57 ng/ml respectively (n=32-38). Tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable to historical data obtained from healthy and HIV+ subjects, suggesting that tenofovir exposure is not substantially altered when coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir. Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir when combined with atazanavir /ritonavir in HIV infected patients with multiple treatment failures: a substudy of Puzzle2- ANRS 107 trial. Taburet, A-M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 55.Steady state atazanavir concentrations were assessed in HIV+ patients taking atazananavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg once daily) with and without tenofovir and/or nevirapine. No significant difference was observed in atazanavir concentrations for patients taking atazanavir/ritonavir alone and those taking tenofovir. There was a trend towards decreased atazanavir concentrations for patients co-dosed with nevirapine (with or without tenofovir). These results from a clinical setting suggest that ritonavir boosting of atazanavir reduces the interaction with tenofovir; however, it may not overcome interactions with nevirapine. Interaction between atazanavir/ritonavir and nevirapine is observed in a clinical setting.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Capecitabine	DB01101	Coadministration has not been studied. Capecitabine is activated by sequential enzyme reactions to fluorouracil. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase plays a role in fluorouracil metabolism. Nucleoside/tide analogues such as tenofovir may compete for or inhibit this metabolism pathway, leading to increased fluorouracil toxicity. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown and clinical monitoring is recommended. 	(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Capreomycin	DB00314	Renal toxicity has been reported during capreomycin treatment. Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides). If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. Capreomycin is predominantly excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, and therefore may potentially compete with tenofovir for renal elimination transport mechanisms, levels of either drug may hypothetically be raised.

However carboplatin and tenofovir both have nephrotoxic potential. Monitoring of renal function is recommended if carboplatin is co-administered with tenofovir and the dosage of tenofovir may need to be adjusted accordingly. 	(See Summary)

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cefalexin		Coadministration has not been studied. Approximately 80% or greater of a cefalexin dose is excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. As tenofovir is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with cefalexin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug. 	(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cefazolin	DB01327	This interaction has not been studied. Cefazolin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, mainly by glomerular filtration with some renal tubular secretion. As temofovir is eliminated by renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition with cefazolin for renal transporters, which could lead to increased levels of either drug. 	(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cefixime	DB00671	This interaction has not been studied. As cefixime is renally excreted predominantly by glomerular filtration, with no significant active renal tubular secretion, there is little potential for interaction via competition with tenofovir for active renal elimination transport mechanisms. 	(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cefotaxime	DB00493	Coadministration has not been studied. Most of a dose of cefotaxime is excreted in the urine - about 60% as unchanged drug and a further 24% as desacetyl-cefotaxime, an active metabolite. In vitro studies have shown that cefotaxime dose-dependently inhibits organic anion uptake mediated by human-OAT2. Probenecid, an inhibitor of renal tubular excretion, interferes with renal tubular transfer of cefotaxime delaying its excretion. As tenofovir is predominantly excreted by active renal tubular secretion, there is potential for competition for renal elimination pathways, which may increase levels of either drug. 	(See Summary)

(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Ceftriaxone	DB01212	Coadministration has not been studied. As ceftriaxone is excreted predominantly by renal glomerular filtration with minimal active renal tubular secretion, there is little potential for interaction via competition with tenofovir for active renal transport mechanisms.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Celecoxib	DB00482	Coadministration has not been studied but could potentially result in increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The risk is increased if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Concurrent use of NSAIDs and tenofovir warrants monitoring of renal function. 	(See Summary)

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cidofovir	DB00369	Potential interaction that may increase concentrations due to reduced renal function or competition for active tubular secretion. European SPC does not recommend coadministration unless clearly necessary, and if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has not been evaluated in patients receiving nephrotoxic medicinal products (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2). Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal transporter, human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) (e.g. cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product). This renal transporter (hOAT1) may be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of tenofovir, adefovir and cidofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products might be modified if they are co-administered. In healthy volunteers, a single dose of adefovir dipivoxil given with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in a relevant drug-drug interaction with regard to pharmacokinetics. However, the clinical safety including potential renal effects of the co-administration of adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is unknown. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant use of these medicinal products is not recommended, but if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2009.Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of tenofovir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of other renally eliminated drugs. Some example include, but are not limited to cidofovir, aciclovir, valaciclovir, ganciclovir and valganciclovir. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Limited, March 2010.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cloxacillin	DB01147	Coadministration has not been studied. Cloxacillin is metabolised to a limited extent with the unchanged drug and metabolites being excreted via renal glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Cobicistat (with ATV or DRV)	DB09065	Coadministration with tenofovir-DF increased tenofovir AUC and Cmax by 23% and 55%, but this increase is not considered to be clinically relevant and no dose adjustment of tenofovir is required. Note, cobicistat has been shown to decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 ml/min if tenofovir-DF requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance. There are currently inadequate data to determine whether tenofovir-DF plus cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions than tenofovir-DF without cobicistat. The European SPC for tenofovir-DF advises close renal monitoring of patients receiving tenofovir-DF with a cobicistat-boosted protease inhibitor. The US Prescribing Information for cobicistat does not recommend coadministration of cobicistat and tenofovir-DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent.	(See Summary)

Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) increased darunavir Cmax (16%), AUC (21%) and Cmin (24%). Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 24%, 22% and 37%, respectively. No adjustments to the licensed doses are required. Monitoring of renal function may be indicated in patients with underlying systemic or renal disease, or in patients taking nephrotoxic agents. Coadministration with darunavir/cobicistat has not been studied.	Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (at a dose lower than recommended or with a different dosing regimen) increased tenofovir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 22%, 24% and 37%, respectively. Darunavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin increased by 21%, 16% and 24%, respectively. The increase in tenofovir is from an effect on MDR1 transport in renal tubules. Monitoring of renal function may be indicated when darunavir coadministered with low dose ritonavir is given in combination with tenofovir, particularly in patients with underlying systemic or renal disease, or in patients taking nephrotoxic agents. Prezista Summary of Product Characteristics, Janssen-Cilag Ltd, October 2009.The interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and tenofovir was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily) was studied in 12 subjects. Darunavir and tenofovir exposure was increased. Darunavir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 16%, 21% and 24%, respectively. Tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 24%, 22% and 37%, respectively. Darunavir/ritonavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can be coadministered without any dose adjustments. Prezista Prescribing Information, Tibotec Inc, January 2010.When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was administered with darunavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg twice daily), there was no sigificant effect on darunavir/ritonavir PK parameters. Tenofovir AUC increased by 22% and Cmin increased by 37%. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored.

[Note: coadministration of NSAIDs and tenofovir may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity in particular if an NSAID is used for a long duration, if the patient has a pre-existing renal dysfunction, has a low body weight, or receives other drugs that may increase tenofovir exposure. Concurrent use of NSAIDs and tenofovir warrants monitoring of renal function.] 	(See Summary)
Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Didanosine	DB00900	Coadministration is not recommended due to increased didanosine concentrations and toxicity. If this combination is judged strictly necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for efficacy and didanosine related adverse events. The US Prescribing Informations for didanosine and tenofovir recommend a reduced dose of didanosine (250 mg once daily for adults weighing 60 kg or greater with creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or greater; 200 mg once daily for adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance 60 mL/min or greater).	Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine is not recommended. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Triple NRTI Therapy: There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen [for the treatment of HIV]. Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2009.Coadministration of tenofovir and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When administered with tenofovir, Cmax and AUC of didanosine (administered as either the buffered or enteric-coated formulation) increased significantly. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) with didanosine 400 mg daily. In adults weighing >60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with tenofovir. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing <60 kg. When coadministered, tenofovir and didanosine EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (<400 kcal, 20% fat). Coadministration of didanosine buffered tablet formulation with tenofovir should be under fasted conditions. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and enteric coated ddI (400 mg single dose, n=25 or buffered didanosine (250 or 400 mg once daily for 7 days, n=14) had no effect on tenofovir AUC, Cmax or Cmin. The effect of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) on the pharmacokinetics of didanosine was investigated in HIV-negative subjects and compared to values obtained with didanosine (400 mg) given alone in the fasted state: Didanosine buffered tablets (400 mg (n=10), or 250 mg if <60 kg (n=4), once daily, for 7 days) and tenofovir (fasted, 1 h after didanosine) increased didanosine AUC by 28% and Cmax by 44%. Enteric-coated didanosine (400 mg single dose, fasted) and tenofovir (2 h after ddI, with food) increased didanosine AUC and Cmax both by 48% (n=26). Enteric coated didanosine (400 mg single dose, with food) and tenofovir (simultaneously with ddI) increased didanosine AUC by 60% and Cmax by 64% (n=26). Enteric coated didanosine (250 mg single dose, fasted) and tenofovir (2 h after ddI, with food) had no effect on didanosine AUC and decreased Cmax by 10% (n=28). Enteric coated didanosine (250 mg single dose, fasted) and tenofovir (simultaneously with ddI) had no effect on didanosine Cmax and increased AUC by 14% (n=28). Enteric coated didanosine (250 mg single dose, with food) and tenofovir (simultaneously with ddI) decreased didanosine AUC by 11% and Cmax by 29% (n=28). Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Limited, March 2010.Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk for didanosine-related adverse events. Rare cases of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. When didanosine gastro-resistant capsules were administered 2 hours prior to or concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the AUC for didanosine was on average increased by 48% and 60% respectively. The mean increase in the AUC of didanosine was 44% when the buffered tablets were administered 1 hour prior to tenofovir. In both cases the pharmacokinetic parameters for tenofovir administered with a light meal were unchanged. A reduced didanosine dose (250 mg) has been tested to avoid over-exposure to didanosine in case of co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but this has been associated with reports of high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at early stage within several tested combinations. Co-administration of didanosine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is therefore not recommended, especially in patients with high viral load and low CD4 cell count. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. If this combination is judged strictly necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for efficacy and didanosine related adverse events. Triple NRTI Therapy:There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage when didanosine was combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine as a once daily regimen [for the treatment of HIV]. Videx Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, June 2009.Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. A dose reduction of didanosine taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended. Administer didanosine 250 mg once daily to adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min and didanosine 200 mg once daily to adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. The appropriate dose of didanosine coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min has not been established. Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily with a light meal) and didanosine (400 mg single dose, 2 h before tenofovir) was studied in 26 HIV-negative subjects. AUC and Cmax of ddI both increased by 48%. Data from 25 subjects showed no change in the AUC and Cmax of tenofovir. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (400 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 25 HIV-negative subjects. AUC and Cmax of ddI increased by 60% and 64% respectively. There was no change in the AUC and Cmax of tenofovir. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (200 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 250 mg given alone under fasting conditions, AUC of ddI increased by 16% and Cmax decreased by 12%. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (250 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 400 mg given alone under fasting conditions, there was no change in the AUC of ddI and a 20% decrease in Cmax. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and didanosine (325 mg single dose) together and with a light meal was studied in 33 HIV-negative subjects. When compared to didanosine pharmacokinetics obtained with ddI 400 mg given alone under fasting conditions, AUC of ddI increased by 13% and Cmax decreased by 11%.Videx Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, January 2010.Intracellular concentrations of active phosphate metabolites were determined in three groups of HIV-infected subjects receiving didanosine alone (400 mg once daily, n=16), tenofovir (300 mg once daily, n=8) or didanosine/tenofovir (250/300 mg once daily, n =14). There were no significant differences in ddA-TP or TDF-DP when didanosine or tenofovir were administered alone or in combination. This study does not support the existence of a strong intracellular interaction between didanosine and tenofovir, but can not conclude that there is absolutely no interaction due to small sample size. As ddA-TP concentrations were similar when didanosine given alone (400 mg) or at a reduced dose (250 mg) with tenofovir, the study supports the dose adaptation proposed for this combination.

There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was coadministered with efavirenz. Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Inc, July 2009.Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 14 days) was studied in 29 HIV-negative subjects and showed no change in AUC, Cmax or Cmin of tenofovir. Data from 30 subjects showed no change in efavirenz AUC, Cmax or Cmin. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences International Limited, March 2010.Specific interaction studies have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than lamivudine, zidovudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Clinically significant interactions are not expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways. No dosage adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product. Sustiva Summary of Product Characteristics, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, December 2009.Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 14 days) to 29 subjects resulted in no change in Cmax, AUC or Cmin of either tenofovir or efavirenz. Sustiva Prescribing Information, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, March 2010.The interaction between tenofovir and efavirenz was assessed in TDM samples from groups of HIV+ patients receiving efavirenz (600 mg once daily) alone or with tenofovir (300 mg once daily). Samples were collected 0.5-23.9 h post dose in the control group (n=118) and the tenofovir group (n=126). There was no significant difference between the groups for the time post dose or efavirenz concentrations (2.34 µg/ml vs. 2.22 µg/ml, control vs. plus tenofovir). Assessment of drug-drug interactions between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz in HIV-infected patients. Droste JA, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 41: 37-43. Nine cases have been reported of patients stable on efavirenz therapy who developed neuropsychiatric disturbances following the introduction of tenofovir to their antiretroviral regimens. The patients had been stable on efavirenz-containing regimens for a median duration of 31 months (range 5-58) during which no efavirenz related CNS effects were reported. Moderate to severe neuropsychiatric events occurred within 48 h of starting tenofovir in 5 patients, with symptoms developing in the remaining 4 patients after 2 weeks to 24 months after initiation of tenofovir. Treatment was changed in 6/9 patients; 3 switched from tenofovir to nevirapine, 2 to from tenofovir to zidovudine and one discontinued treatment. All 6 patients exhibited marked improvement in CNS intolerance. Of the 3 patients who remained on efavirenz and tenofovir, one had spontaneous progressive improvement within 2 weeks, but two had chronic persistent sleeping disorders. Efavirenz plasma concentrations were available for 2 patients before tenofovir (1.35 and 2.09 µg/ml) and for 4 patients on tenofovir (1.30-1.95 µg/ml). The neuropsychiatric disorders could be either a consequence of an unexplained interaction between efavirenz and tenofovir, or an infrequent tenofovir-related side effect. Further studies are required to evaluate precisely the incidence of these symptoms, including the assessment of efavirenz binding sites or metabolites. Neuropsychiatric adverse events after switching from an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz without tenofovir to an efavirenz regimen containing tenofovir: a report of nine cases.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Fosamprenavir	DB01319	In a Phase III clinical trial (APV30003), plasma amprenavir trough concentrations were similar for subjects receiving tenofovir in combination with fosamprenavir/ritonavir as compared to subjects not receiving tenofovir. No recommendations can be drawn at this stage on the co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with tenofovir. 	No recommendations can be drawn at this stage on the co-administration of fosamprenavir with ritonavir with tenofovir. Telzir Summary of Product Characteristics, GlaxoSmithKline UK, May 2009. Plasma amprenavir trough concentrations were similar for subjects receiving tenofovir disproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) in combination with fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily, n=45; 1400/200 mg once daily, n=60) when compared with a parallel control group not receiving tenofovir. Lexiva Prescribing Information, GlaxoSmithKline, September 2009.The potential interaction between fosamprenavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was investigated in 36 healthy subjects who received tenofovir (300 mg once daily for 7 days, period 1), and then were randomized to 14 days of either fosamprenavir (1400 mg twice daily) or fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg twice daily) alone or with tenofovir (period 2). Subjects continued their randomized dose of fosamprenavir±ritonavir for 14 more days (period 3), adding or removing tenofovir based upon its receipt in period 2. Plasma amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics were assessed on the last day of each period. Tenofovir Cmin, Cmax and AUC decreased by 12%, 25% and 15% after fosamprenavir coadministration and by 9%, 18% and 7% after fosamprenavir/ritonavir coadministration. Unboosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 3% and 7% after tenofovir coadministration; boosted amprenavir Cmin, Cmax and AUC increased by 31%, 4% and 16% with tenofovir. No significant changes in ritonavir pharmacokinetics were observed. The authors conclude that the increases in amprenavir exposures and modest decreases in tenofovir exposures are unlikely to be clinically significant. Steady-state amprenavir and tenofovir pharmacokinetics after coadministration of unboosted or ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in healthy volunteers. Luber AD, Condoluci DV, Slowinski PD, et al. HIV Med, 2010,11(3): 193-199.This study was a prospective phase I crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers who received fosamprenavir/ritonavir (1400/100 or 1400/200 mg once daily) with or without tenofovir (300 mg once daily) for 14 days. Tenofovir was added or discontinued (cross over) for another 14 days, with pharmacokinetics being assessed on days 14 and 28. There was no effect of tenofovir on amprenavir AUC or Cmax in either regimen. Tenofovir led to significant increases in ritonavir AUC (32%) and Cmax (71%) when given with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg. However, the authors conclude that no dose modification is necessary when combining fosamprenavir/ritonavir with tenofovir. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics: no effect of tenofovir. Kurowski M, Walli RK, Breske A, et al. AIDS, 2007, 21(10): 1368-1370. The interaction between TDF (300 mg once daily) and FPV/RTV (1400/100 mg or 1400/200 mg once daily) was investigated in healthy male subjects. The 24 h PK profiles for APV were similar for the two groups. There was no effect of TDF on APV AUC in either the 100 mg (GMR=0.99) or 200 mg (GMR=1.06) RTV groups. APV Cmax was unaffected by TDF in the 100 mg group (GMR=1.04), whereas the 200 mg group showed a non-significant increase (GMR=1.11). APV Ctrough showed non-significant increases in both groups (100 mg GMR=1.24, 200 mg GMR=1.02). There was a non-significant trend to higher RTV AUC in the 200 mg group. TDF monophosphate AUC and Cmax showed a non-significant trend to being lower in the 200 mg group, but with a higher Ctrough. Coadministration of TDF with FPV/RTV was generally well tolerated and the absence of relevant interactions suggests that no dose modification is necessary. Coadministration of tenofovir 300 mg once daily with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100 mg once daily or 1400/200 mg once daily does not affect amprenavir pharmacokinetics. Kurowski, M et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 10.The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of the FPV/RTV-TDF interaction in HIV+ patients (n=21) receiving FPV/RTV (700/100 mg twice daily) in combination with TDF (300 mg once daily). Median (range) trough concentrations were 1586 (867-2925) ng/ml for APV, 166 (30-615) ng/ml for RTV and 64 (31-226) ng/ml for TDF. Trough concentrations were in the adequate ranges and no clinically relevant PK interaction was found.Plasma concentrations of amprenavir, ritonavir and tenofovir in HIV-infected patients treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir (700/100 mg BID) and tenofovir (300 mg QD) containing regimen.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir		Coadministration of tenofovir (in combination with efavirenz/emtricitabine or rilpivirine/emtricitabine) increased tenofovir exposure. Tenofovir concentrations may also be increased when given with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and an HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and elvitegravir, cobicistat and emtricitabine. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in these settings has not been established. If coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and tenofovir with an HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions, including frequent renal monitoring. Note, coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and tenofovir with elvitegravir, cobicistat and emtricitabineis not recommended.	Coadministration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (600/200/300 mg once daily) and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/400 mg once daily) was studied. Efavirenz Cmax, AUC and Cmin decreased by 13%, 10% and 9%; emtricitabine Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 8%, 5% and 4%; tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 79%, 98% and 163%. Ledipasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin all decreased by 33%; sofosbuvir Cmax increased by 3% but AUC decreased by 6%; Cmax and AUC of GS-331007 decreased by 14% and 10% but Cmin increased by 7%.

No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 was observed with the combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir. Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily with emtricitabine/rilpivirine) and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/400 mg once daily) to 14 subjects increased tenofovir Cmax, AUC and Cmin by 32%, 40% and 91%, respectively. No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and GS-331007 was observed. Coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and regimens containing tenofovir and a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir may increase tenofovir concentrations. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in the setting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir has not been established. Consider alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in tenofovir exposures. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Coadministration of tenofovir in combination with elvitegravir, cobicistat and emtricitabine may increase tenofovir concentrations. The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in the setting of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and the combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir has not been established.

Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and tenofovir should be more closely monitored for renal function.	Coadministration of Kaletra and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) increased tenofovir AUC and Cmin by 32% and 51% respectively, but had no effect on Cmax. Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events, including renal disorders. No dose adjustment necessary. Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics, Abbott Laboratories Ltd, December 2009.Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily for 14 days) and lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily for 14 days) to 24 HIV- volunteers resulted in no change in the Cmax, AUC or Cmin of lopinavir. There was no change in tenofovir Cmax, but increases of 32% and 51% in tenofovir AUC and Cmin respectively. Kaletra increased tenofovir concentrations; the mechanism of this inteaction is unknown. Patients receiving Kaletra and tenofovir should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir. Kaletra Prescribing Information, Abbott Laboratories, January 2010.When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg once daily) was administered with lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily), there was no sigificant effect on lopinavir/ritonavir PK parameters. Tenofovir AUC increased by 32%, Cmin increased by 51%, and there was no change in Cmax. No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored. Viread Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences International Ltd, July 2009.Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice times daily for 14 days) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers. There was no change in tenofovir Cmax; AUC and Cmin increased by 32% and 51% respectively. There was no change in Cmax, AUC or Cmin for lopinavir or ritonavir. The mechanism for the increase in tenofovir concentrations is unknown. Patients should be monitored for tenofovir associated adverse events: tenofovir should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse events. Viread Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, March 2010.The plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir and abacavir, lamivudine or lopinavir was investigated in HIV+ subjects receiving TDF + 3TC/LPV (n=7), TDF + 3TC/NVP (n=8), TDF + ABC/LPV (n=7) or TDF + ABC/NVP (n=5). Tenofovir exposure increased when given with LPV (39% increase in Cmax, 72% increase in AUC) with intracellular tenofovir-DP AUC increasing by 35%. A pharmacokinetic study in HIV infected patients under tenofovir fumarate: investigation of systemic and intracellular interaction between TDF and abacavir, or lamivudine or lopinavir/ritonavir. Pruvost A, et al. 8th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Budapest, April 2007, abstract 56.The pharmacokinetic interaction between tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and lopinavir (400/100 mg twice daily) was determined in 27 HIV-negative subjects. Coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir increase tenofovir AUC (32%), Cmax (15%) and Cmin (51%). Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics were unaffected by tenofovir (n=24). Clinical estimates of renal function were unaffected by administration of tenofovir alone or with lopinavir/ritonavir. The increase in tenofovir exposure is not believed to be clinically relevant based on the safety and efficacy of this combination in HIV-infected patients in long-term controlled clinical trials. Pharmacokinetics and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on coadministration with lopinavir/ritonavir. Kearney BP, Mathias A, Mittan A, et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2006, 43: 278-283.The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) on the renal clearance of tenofovir was investigated in HIV-infected subjects receiving tenofovir (300 mg once daily) alone or in combination with LPV/r. Tenofovir clearance was 16% lower in subjects receiving LPV/r, consistent with a renal interaction between tenofovir and LPV/r. There was no difference in tenofovir-diphosphate concentrations when tenofovir was given alone or in combination. Effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the renal clearance of tenofovir in HIV-infected patients. Kiser J, et al. 13th Conference on Opportunistic Infections and Retroviruses, Denver, February 2006, abstract 570. Significant increases in TDF plasma exposure have been reported when coadministered with Kaletra. This study looked at the interaction at the intracellular level by investigating the effect of LPV/RTV (400/100 once daily) on TDF-DP concentrations in HIV+ patients taking TDF (300 mg once daily). There was a trend to higher TDF-DP concentrations when used in combination with LPV/r. However, due to interpatient variability, this did not reach statistical significance. Mean ± SD TDF-DP concentrations were 181.4 ± 80.1 and 280.3 ± 181.8 fmol/106 cells, alone and in combination with LPV/RTV respectively. Since target concentrations have yet to be defined for TDF-DP, the possible consequences of this increase remain unknown. Possible interaction between tenofovir and boosted lopinavir; analysis at the intracellular level in HIV infected patients. Benech, H et al. 6th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology of HIV Therapy, Quebec, April 2005, abstract 34.The effect of tenofovir on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir was investigated in 18 treatment experienced HIV+ patients. Lopinavir concentrations decreased in the presence of tenofovir (Cmin from 4.61 to 3.06 µg/ml; Cmax from 10.68 to 9.65 µg/ml). Decreases in ritonavir concentrations were also observed (Cmin from 0.63 to 0.35 µg/ml; Cmax from 1.02 to 0.72 µg/ml). Therapeutic drug monitoring of lopinavir when coadministered with tenofovir may be useful to indicate if individual dose modification of lopinavir and/or ritonavir is required.

Davis JrC, Gillam B, Amoroso A, et al. 11th European AIDS Conference, Madrid, October 2007, abstract P4.1/03.The interaction between tenofovir and nevirapine was assessed in TDM samples from groups of HIV+ patients receiving nevirapine (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily) alone or with tenofovir (300 mg once daily). For twice daily dosing, although nevirapine samples were collected at various times post dose (0.2-14.3 h), there was no significant difference in the times post dose between the control group (n=272) and the tenofovir group (n=39). Nevirapine concentrations were not significantly different between the groups (5.68 µg/ml vs. 6.48 µg/ml, control vs. tenofovir). For once daily dosing, samples were collected 0-24.4 h post dose in the control group (n=18) and the tenofovir group (n=94). There was no significant difference between the groups for the time post dose or nevirapine concentrations (5.25 µg/ml vs. 4.85 µg/ml, control vs. plus tenofovir).

Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.Cirrhotic  chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients’ clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score ≥6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities.

The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and/or tenofovir was generally similar to that of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore no dose adjustment is required. 	Tenofovir may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, the mechanism for this effect is unknown. Coadministration of tenofovir and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir AUC by 49%, Cmax by 64% and Cmin by 3%. Tenofovir AUC decreased by 10%, Cmax by 33% and Cmin by 13%. The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and/or tenofovir was generally similar to the safety profile of patients who did not use these agents. Therefore no dose adjustment is required. Isentress Summary of Product Characteristics, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, September 2009.Coadministration of tenofovir (300 mg once daily) and raltegravir (400 mg twice daily) increased raltegravir Cmax by 64%, AUC by 49% and Cmin by 3% (n=9). Raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir. Isentress Prescribing Information, Merck & Co Inc, October 2009.Coadministration of raltegravir (400 mg twice daily for 4 days) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily for 7 days) alone and in combination for 4 days was studied in HIV- subjects. Pharmacokinetic profiles were also determined in HIV+ patients given raltegravir monotherapy alone or in combination with tenofovir/lamivudine. In healthy volunteers raltegravir AUC and Cmax were modestly increased in the presence of tenofovir (49% and 64%, respectively), while there was no effect of tenofovir on raltegravir Cmin (3% increase). However, there was a modest increase of 42% in Cmin in HIV-infected patients. Raltegravir only had a small effect on tenofovir AUC (10% decrease), Cmax (23% decrease) and Cmin (13% decrease). The authors conclude that coadministration of raltegravir and tenofovir does not change the pharmacokinetics of either drug to a clinically meaningful degree and consequently may be coadministered without dose adjustments.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Ribavirin	DB00811	In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of tenofovir and ribavirin does not result in substantial changes to the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug. However, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving NRTI-containing HIV therapy and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anaemia.	In a 36-day, open-label, fixed-sequence interaction study to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin, healthy volunteers (n=23) received a 600-mg once-daily oral dose of ribavirin on days 1 and 22 and 300-mg once-daily oral doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on days 17 through 24. Pharmacokinetics of ribavirin was not altered by its coadministration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Tenofovir pharmacokinetics after ribavirin coadministration was similar to that observed in previous studies. These results indicate that coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and ribavirin does not result in substantial changes to their individual pharmacokinetic profiles.Absence of clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between ribavirin and tenofovir in Healthy Subjects. Ramanathan S, Cheng A, Mittan A et al. J Clin Pharmacol 2006;46:559-566.  Patients receiving PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a)/COPEGUS (ribavirin) and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management. In addition, dose reduction or discontinuation of PEGASYS (peginterferon alfa-2a), COPEGUS (ribavirin) or both should also be considered if worsening toxicities are observed.Copegus US Prescribing Information, Genetech USA Inc, June 2010.Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin. Adding treatment with alpha interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset. Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) should be closely monitored for treatment- associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation and anemia. Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6).Rebetol US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, November 2009.Cirrhotic  chronic HCV patients coinfected with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin appear to be at increased risk for the development of hepatic decompensation compared to patients not receiving HAART. In a study of 129 HCV/HIV cirrhotic patients receiving HAART, 14 (11%) of these patients across all treatment arms developed hepatic decompensation resulting in 6 deaths. All 14 patients were on NRTIs, including stavudine, didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. These small numbers of patients do not permit discrimination between specific NRTIs for the associated risk. During treatment, patients’ clinical status and hepatic function should be closely monitored, and PEGASYS treatment should be immediately discontinued if decompensation (Child-Pugh score ≥6) is observed. Patients receiving PEGASYS/COPEGUS and NRTIs should be closely monitored for treatment associated toxicities. Physicians should refer to prescribing information for the respective NRTIs for guidance regarding toxicity management.

Stavudine extended release formulation and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: lack of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction. Kaul S, et al. 11th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, San Francisco, February 2004, abstract 602. The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the extended release formulation of stavudine (d4T-XR 100 mg) and tenofovir (300 mg once daily) were studied in 18 HIV-negative subjects. Plasma d4T concentration-versus time profile for the d4T XR+TDF treatment was super-imposable on the profile for the d4T XR alone treatment. The geometric mean (%CV) for Cmax and AUC, and median Tmax values were 274 (31%) ng/ml, 2,682 (29%) ng.h/mL, and 5 h, respectively, for the d4T XR alone treatment; the corresponding values for the d4T XR+TDF treatment were 275 (26%) ng/ml, 2,765 (28%), and 4 h, respectively.

Tenofovir-DF (HBV)		Streptomycin	DB01082	The European SPC does not recommend coadministration unless clearly necessary, and if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 	Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport proteins hOAT 1, hOAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products.  Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2. If concomitant use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly.

However, as both vancomycin and tenofovir are potentially nephrotoxic, monitoring of renal function with concomitant use is advised. A case study has described renal failure in two HIV+ patients taking tenofovir and a prolonged course of vancomycin. 	Use of tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with  concurrent or recent use of  a nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g.  aminoglycosides, amphotericin B,  foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine,  vancomycin, cidofovir or  interleukin-2). If concomitant use of tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate and  nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal  function should be monitored  weekly.Viread  Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, August 2011. Renal failure  developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in two patients  who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an  antiretroviral regimen. Tenofovir has been implicated in the development  of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on  the proximal renal tubule.

No effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 or velpatasvir was observed. Monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions.	Epclusa has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure (P-gp-inhibition). The increase in tenofovir exposure (AUC and Cmax) was around 40-80% during co-treatment with Epclusa and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine as part of various HIV regimens. Patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and Epclusa concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Refer to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing product’s Summary of Product Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. Epclusa has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).

Telbivudine 		Peg-IFN alfa		Coadministration with pegylated or standard interferon alfa is contraindicated. The pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose coadministration with pegylated interferon alfa-2a. No definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon due to high interindividual variability. A clinical trial investigating coadministration indicates that the combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known. The combination of telbivudine with any interferon alfa-containing product is contraindicated. 	The steady-state pharmacokinetics of telbivudine were unaltered following multiple dose administration in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a. No definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon due to high interindividual variability of pegylated interferon alfa-2a concentrations. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination is associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known. The combination of telbivudine with any interferon alfa-containing product is contraindicated.Sebivo Summary of Product Characteristics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, January 2011. Combination of telbivudine with pegylated interferon alfa-2a is contraindicated because of increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Drug-drug interaction studies show that pegylated interferon alfa- 2a does not alter telbivudine pharmacokinetics. No definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of telbivudine on the pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon alfa-2a due to the high inter-individual variability of pegylated interferon alfa-2a concentrations. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported with telbivudine alone or in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and other interferons. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine, 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration, indicates that this combination may be associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy occurrence and severity, in comparison to telbivudine or pegylated interferon alfa-2a alone. The safety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with pegylated interferons or other interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated.Tyzeka US Prescribing Information, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, December 2011. A clinical trial investigating the combination of telbivudine 600 mg daily, with pegylated interferon alfa-2a, 180 micrograms once weekly by subcutaneous administration for the treatment of HBV, indicates that the combination is associated with an increased risk for developing peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism behind these events is not known; thus, co-treatment with telbivudine and other interferons (pegylated or standard) may also entail an excess risk. Moreover, the benefit of the combination of telbivudine with interferon alfa (pegylated or standard) is not currently established. Therefore, the combination of Pegasys with telbivudine is contraindicated.Pegasys Summary of Product Characteristics, Roche Products Ltd, December 2011.Peripheral neuropathy has been reported when alpha interferons were given in combination with telbivudine. In one clinical trial, an increased risk and severity of peripheral neuropathy was observed with the combination use of telbivudine and pegylated interferon-alfa 2a as compared to telbivudine alone. The safety and efficacy of telbivudine in combination with interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B has not been demonstrated.Pegasys US Prescribing Information, Genentech Inc, June 2010.PegIntron US Prescribing Information, Schering Corporation, January 2010.

Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Acitretin	DB00459	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as acitretin undergoes isomerisation and glucuronidation which are not affected by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Adefovir		Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Adefovir is largely excreted unchanged via renal glomerular filtration and active renal secretion by OAT1. Velpatasvir/sofosbuvir do not inhibit this transporter.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Agomelatine	DB06594	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as agomelatine is metabolized predominantly by CYP1A2 which is not affected by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir. Note, agomelatine is contraindicated in hepatic impairment as increases in exposure of 140-fold have been seen in cirrhotic patients.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Albendazole	DB00518	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Albendazole is metabolized in part by CYP3A4 which is not affected by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Albiglutide	DB09043	Coadministration has not been studied. Albiglutide delays gastric emptying and therefore may affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. The clinical effect of this is unknown.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Alendronic acid	DB00630	Coadministration has not been studied. Alendronate is not metabolised and is cleared from the plasma by uptake into bone and elimination via renal excretion. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other oral medicines.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Alfentanil	DB00802	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Alfentanil is metabolised by CYP3A4 which is not affected by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir.	(See Summary)

Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Aluminium hydroxide		Coadministration has not been studied but may decrease velpatasvir concentrations due the increase in gastric pH. Administration of an antacid and velpatasvir/sofosbuvir should be separated by 4 hours.	Velpatasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. Medicinal products that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease the concentration of velpatasvir. No effect on sofosbuvir concentrations is expected. It is recommended to separate antacid and Epclusa administration by 4 hours.Epclusa Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, July 2016.Velpatasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. Drugs that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease concentration of velpatasvir. Separate antacid and Epclusa administration by 4 hours. Epclusa US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, June 2016.
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Alverine citrate		Coadministration has not been studied but based on limited understanding of metabolism and clearance a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely. However as alverine citrate affects gastric motility, an effect on the absorption of velpatasvir/sofosbuvir cannot be ruled out. Doses of velpatasvir/sofosbuvir and alverine should be separated by 4 hours if possible. 	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amantadine	DB00915	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as amantadine is only metabolized to a minor extent (principally N-acetylation) and is largely excreted unchanged in urine.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Ambrisentan	DB06403	Coadministration has not been studied. Ambrisartan is a substrate of P-gp and concentrations may increase due to mild inhibition of P-gp by velpatasvir, however, this is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Although both drugs are substrates of P-gp, no effect on sofosbuvir concentrations is expected.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amikacin	DB00479	Coadministration has not been studied. Ambrisartan is a substrate of P-gp and concentrations may increase due to mild inhibition of P-gp by velpatasvir, however, this is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Although both drugs are substrates of P-gp, no effect on sofosbuvir concentrations is expected.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amiloride	DB00594	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amiloride is not metabolised by the liver with approximately 50% of an oral dose excreted in urine.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amiodarone	DB01118	Coadministration has not been studied and is not recommended. Coadministration of amiodarone and sofosbuvir combined with another direct acting antiviral such as velpatasvir may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. The effect on amiodarone, sofosbuvir, and velpatasvir concentrations unknown. If coadministration is required as no other alternative is available, cardiac monitoring is recommended.	Interaction not studied. Effect on amiodarone, velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir concentrations unknown. Use only if no other alternative is available. Close monitoring is recommended if this medicinal product is administered with Epclusa. Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir used in combination with another direct acting antiviral (DAA), is used with concomitant amiodarone with or without other medicinal products that lower heart rate. The mechanism is not established. The concomitant use of amiodarone was limited through the clinical development of sofosbuvir plus DAAs. Cases are potentially life threatening, therefore amiodarone should only be used in patients on Epclusa when other alternative anti-arrhythmic treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients are closely monitored when initiating Epclusa. Patients who are identified as being at high risk of bradyarrhythmia should be continuously monitored for 48 hours in an appropriate clinical setting. Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, appropriate monitoring should also be carried out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated on Epclusa.Epclusa Summary of Product Characteristics, Gilead Sciences Ltd, July 2016.Coadministration of amiodarone with Epclusa may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. The effect on amiodarone, sofosbuvir, and velpatasvir concentrations unknown. Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with sofosbuvir in combination with daclatasvir or simeprevir. Coadministration of amiodarone with Epclusa is not recommended; if coadministration is required, cardiac monitoring is recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered Epclusa, a) counsel patients about the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, and b) cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who are taking Epclusa who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Due to amiodarone’s long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting Epclusa should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.Epclusa US Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences Inc, June 2016
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amisulpride	DB06288	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely as amisulpride is largely excreted unchanged in urine and undergoes relatively little metabolism.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amitriptyline	DB00321	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amitriptyline is metabolised predominantly by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 which are not affected by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir.	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amlodipine	DB00381	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Although amlodipine is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, no clinically significant effect on velpatasvir is expected. Concentrations of sofosbuvir, but not the main circulating metabolite GS-331007, may increase but no a priori dose modification is recommended. Amlodipine is a substrate of P-gp and concentrations may increase due to mild inhibition of P-gp by velpatasvir, however, this is unlikely to warrant a dose change but monitor heart rate and blood pressure. 	(See Summary)
Velpatasvir/Sofosbuvir		Amodiaquine	DB00613	Coadministration has not been studied but based on metabolism and clearance a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Amodiaquine is metabolised by CYP2C8 which is not affected by velpatasvir/sofosbuvir.	(See Summary)
