                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied. There is no evidence in humans or animals that alendronic acid undergoes metabolism, therefore, a pharmacokinetic interaction appears unlikely. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications. However, if taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product. </span>

<div>The interaction between sofosbuvir and darunavir/ritonavir was evaluated in clinical trials and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug. Coadministration of darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) and sofosbuvir (400 mg single dose) was studied in 18 subjects. Cmax and AUC of sofosbuvir increased by 45% and 34% respectively. &nbsp;Cmax of GS-331007 decreased by 3%, but AUC increased by 24%.

<div>Coadministration a single dose of sofosbuvir (400 mg) before and after 10 days of darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) was studied in 18 subjects.

The AUC and Cmin of GS-331007 (the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir) increased by 48% and 66% with no change in Cmax; there no change in the AUC, Cmin or Cmax of the metabolite GS-566500. Elvitegravir AUC and Cmax were unchanged, but Cmin increased by 46%. Cobicistat AUC and Cmin increased by 53% and 225%, but Cmax was unchanged.

<p>Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of Genvoya, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected with Genvoya. Coadministration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90/400 mg once daily) and elvitegravir/cobicistat (150/150 mg once daily) decreased elvitegravir Cmax by 12% and increase AUC and Cmin by 2% and 36% (n=29). Cobicistat Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 25%, 59% and 325%, respectively. Ledipasvir Cmax, AUC and Cmin increased by 63%, 78% and 91%.

                      <span>Coadministration has not been studied but, based on metabolism and clearance, a clinically significant interaction is unlikely. Formoterol is eliminated primarily by direct glucuronidation, with O-demethylation followed by further glucuronidation being another pathway. As multiple CYP450 isoenzymes (2D6, 2C19, 2C9, and 2A6) catalyze the transformation and sofosbuvir does not affect CYP enzymes, the potential for interactions is low. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and formation of its active metabolite is unlikely to be affected by comedications.</span>
